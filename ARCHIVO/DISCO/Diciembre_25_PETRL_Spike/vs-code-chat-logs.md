## Request Messages
### System
~~~md
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5.
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section
<fileLinkification>
When mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.
NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:
- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.
- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.

REQUIRED FORMATS:
- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)
- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)
- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)

PATH RULES:
- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.
- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.
- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.
- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://
- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).
- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.
- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).
- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.
- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)
- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.

FORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):
- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.
- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.
- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.
- Specific line citations without links ("Line 86", "at line 86", "on line 25").
- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)


</fileLinkification>
Use KaTeX for math equations in your answers.
Wrap inline math equations in $.
Wrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.

</outputFormatting>

## SCRIPT-1.28.0 — Blueprint MMCO Enhancement

> **Objetivo**: Corregir navegación del Blueprint MMCO para presentación Talaia/Flove  
> **Sprint**: FC2 (actual)  
> **Effort total**: 3 pts  
> **Estado**: ✅ Cerrada (2025-12-27)  
> **Contexto**: Las diapositivas estaban superpuestas por usar solo eje Z sin separación X/Y

### Problema Detectado

| Aspecto | Antes | Después |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Coordenadas | Todas en (X=0, Y=0), solo variando Z | Distribuidas en eje Y vertical |
| Navegación | Diapositivas superpuestas ilegibles | Flujo vertical ascendente 0c→4 |
| Vista panorámica | Maraña apretada | Layout vertical claro |

### Solución Implementada

Layout Lineal Vertical:

```
bnp (y=-2500)         ← Nivel 0c (base)
correlations (y=-1500) ← Nivel 0b
tensors (y=-500)       ← Nivel 0a
geometry (y=500)       ← Nivel 1 (centro)
time (y=1500)          ← Nivel 2
spacetime (y=2500)     ← Nivel 3
matter (y=3500)        ← Nivel 4
overview-mmco (y=500, z=3000, scale=6)
```

### Tasks Completadas

| Task | Descripción | Estado |
|------|-------------|--------|
| T001 | Actualizar coordenadas de las 8 diapositivas | ✅ |
| T002 | Verificar navegación local con Jekyll + Playwright | ✅ |
| T003 | Tomar screenshots de validación | ✅ |
| T004 | Commit y actualizar BACKLOG | ✅ |

## SCRIPT-1.27.0 — Blueprint MMCO Compliance

> **Objetivo**: Refactorizar el Blueprint visual para que refleje la ontología formal (MetaModel) y la jerarquía de emergencia (MMCO) del Scriptorium  
> **Sprint**: FC2 (actual)  
> **Effort total**: 21 pts  
> **Estado**: ✅ Cerrada (2025-12-27)  
> **Contexto**: El blueprint actual (SCRIPT-1.26.0) satisface UX pero no cumple el objetivo de FC1: modelar Scriptorium con terminología MetaModel/MMCO

### El Gap

| Aspecto | Blueprint Actual | Blueprint MMCO |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Lenguaje | Comercial/funcional | Terminología MetaModel + MMCO |
| Estructura | Taxonomía plana (capas) | Jerarquía de Emergencia (0c→4) |
| Dinámicas | Flujos lineales | Meta-Dinámicas (coherencia→tiempo) |
| Slides | 7 diapositivas funcionales | 7 niveles de emergencia MMCO |

### Mapeo MMCO → Blueprint

| Nivel MMCO | Slide Blueprint | Contenido |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0c (BNP) | `#bnp` | ARCHIVO como potencial de conocimiento |
| 0b (Correlaciones) | `#correlations` | Red de agentes + handoffs (grafo) |
| 0a (Tensores) | `#tensors` | Estado actual: git status, DISCO |
| 1 (Proto-geometría) | `#geometry` | Estructura de proyectos, plugins |
| 2 (Pseudo-tiempo) | `#time` | Sprints, commits, releases |
| 3 (Espacio-tiempo) | `#spacetime` | Publicaciones: GH-Pages, docs |
| 4 (Materia) | `#matter` | Productos finales: Teatro, Periódico, Fundación |

### Estrategia de Implementación

**Opción elegida**: **Segundo blueprint alternativo** (`/blueprint-mmco/`) que coexiste con el actual.

Justificación:
- El blueprint actual (UX-focused) es útil para usuarios nuevos
- El blueprint MMCO es para colaboradores que entienden el modelo
- Permitir toggle entre ambas vistas

### Detalle de Stories

#### S01: Estructura 7 Slides MMCO (3 pts)

**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T01 | Crear `docs/blueprint-mmco.md` con layout MMCO | ✅ |
| T02 | Definir posiciones 3D para jerarquía de emergencia | ✅ |
| T03 | CSS: estilos específicos para niveles 0c→4 | ✅ |

**Posiciones propuestas** (Z-axis = nivel de emergencia):
```
Nivel 0c (BNP):     z: -3000 (más profundo, potencial)
Nivel 0b:           z: -2000
Nivel 0a:           z: -1000
Nivel 1:            z: 0 (centro)

Nivel 3:            z: 2000
Nivel 4 (Matter):   z: 3000 (más cercano, actual)
```

#### S02: Slide 0c — BNP (3 pts)

**Concepto**: El ARCHIVO como "Basic Narrative Potential" — el plenum de posibilidad del que emerge todo.

**Visualización**:
- Fondo: gradiente difuso (potencialidad no-diferenciada)
- Tres esferas superpuestas: `marco/`, `diagnóstico/`, `justificación/`
- Texto MMCO: "BNP: Potencial narrativo básico"

**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T04 | Diseño visual del "campo ontológico" | ✅ |
| T05 | Conectar con contenido real de ARCHIVO/ | ✅ |

#### S03: Slide 0b — Correlaciones (5 pts)

**Concepto**: Red de agentes y handoffs como "correlaciones pre-métricas".

**Visualización**:
- Grafo interactivo (Mermaid o D3.js)
- Nodos = agentes (color por capa)
- Aristas = handoffs (direccionales)
- Hover: muestra descripción del handoff

**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T06 | Extraer grafo de handoffs desde agentes/*.agent.md | ✅ |
| T07 | Renderizar como Mermaid flowchart LR | ✅ |
| T08 | Interactividad: click navega a agente | ⏳ |

#### S04: Slide 1 — Proto-geometría (2 pts)

**Concepto**: La estructura de carpetas/plugins como "geometría pre-espacial".

**Visualización**:
- Tree diagram de `.github/plugins/`
- Conexiones con `ARCHIVO/PLUGINS/` (código ↔ datos)

#### S05: Slide 2 — Pseudo-tiempo (3 pts)

**Concepto**: Sprints y commits como "tiempo emergente de la coherencia".

**Visualización**:
- Timeline horizontal
- Nodos = releases (v1.0.0-beta.1, etc.)
- Área = effort completado por sprint
- Conexión con `@scrum` y backlog

#### S06: Slides 3-4 (2 pts)

**Nivel 3 (Espacio-tiempo)**: Publicaciones en GH-Pages
**Nivel 4 (Materia)**: Productos finales (Teatro, Periódico, Fundación)

#### S07: Toggle entre blueprints (2 pts)

**UX**: Botón en ambos blueprints para cambiar vista.

```html
<a href="/blueprint/">Vista UX</a> | <a href="/blueprint-mmco/">Vista MMCO</a>
```
**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T09 | Añadir toggle en `docs/blueprint.md` | ✅ |
| T10 | Añadir toggle en `docs/blueprint-mmco.md` | ✅ |
| T11 | Actualizar `docs/index.md`: añadir enlace a Blueprint MMCO | ✅ |
| T12 | Actualizar nav en `_config.yml` si procede | ⏳ |
#### S08: Documentar modelo (1 pt)

Crear `OnthologyEditor/scriptorium/README.md` explicando:
- Mapeo MetaModel → Agentes
- Mapeo MMCO → Dinámicas del Scriptorium
- Cómo se relaciona con φ_editor

### Criterios de Aceptación

- [ ] Blueprint MMCO navegable en 7 slides
- [ ] Cada slide usa terminología MMCO correcta
- [ ] Slide 0b muestra grafo de handoffs real
- [ ] Toggle UX↔MMCO funciona
- [ ] Documentación en OnthologyEditor/scriptorium/

### Riesgos

| Riesgo | Probabilidad | Impacto | Mitigación |
|--------|--------------|---------|------------|
| MMCO demasiado abstracto para visualizar | Media | Alto | Usar metáforas visuales (profundidad Z) |
| Grafo de handoffs muy complejo | Media | Medio | Filtrar por capa, mostrar subgrafos |
| Confusión entre dos blueprints | Baja | Bajo | Navegación clara, labels distintos |

> **Effort total**: 37 puntos  
> **Estado**: ✅ Aprobado

### Concepto

Aplicar los frameworks **Metamodel** (ontología formal) y **MMCO** (métricas de coherencia) al Scriptorium para:
1. Especificar formalmente agentes, plugins y dominios
2. Medir coherencia en partidas ARG y producción editorial
3. Integrar con @decoherence, @ox y las 5 Banderas

### SCRIPT-1.23.0 — MMCO Editor Transmedia (Validación Paradigmática)

> **Objetivo**: Validar si MMCO+Metamodel son aplicables al Scriptorium como sistema de producción editorial  
> **Effort total**: 15 pts (13 original + 2 PromptCraft)  
> **Técnica**: O.R.G.A.N.I.Z.E (Graph, ToT, Self-Consistency) + P.R.O.M.P.T  
> **Dependencias**: Ninguna (autocontenida — valida antes de depender)  
> **Estado**: 🆕 Refactorizada (2025-12-28)  
> **Conversación**: [DISCO/Diciembre_25_MMCO_Editor/conversacion.md](../../ARCHIVO/DISCO/Diciembre_25_MMCO_Editor/conversacion.md)  
> **Recursos**: [PromptCraft.md](../../ARCHIVO/DISCO/Diciembre_25_MMCO_Editor/PromptCraft.md) (Talaia Digital)

#### Contexto de Refactorización

Sesión editorial meta-recursiva (5W + 5 Banderas) reveló:
- Fórmula lineal `Φ_editor = Σ(w·Φ_bandera)` teóricamente injustificada
- Cada bandera opera con técnica de razonamiento diferente (CoT, ToT, Graph, Self-Consistency)
- Sin validación previa de aplicabilidad de MMCO al dominio editorial

**Decisión PO (@pathykar)**: Invertir orden — validar primero, formalizar después.

## SCRIPT-1.29.0 — ScriptoriumPack (Context Bloat Mitigation) ✅

> **Objetivo**: Crear plugin que encapsula instrucciones core del Scriptorium con patrones `applyTo` optimizados para reducir context bloat  
> **Sprint**: FC2 (actual)  
> **Effort total**: 28 pts (Fase 1: 13 pts ✅ | Fase 2: 15 pts ✅)  
> **Estado**: ✅ Completado (2025-12-28)  
> **Contexto**: [critica-prompting-pathykar.md](../../ARCHIVO/DISCO/Diciembre_25_MMCO_Editor/critica-prompting-pathykar.md) + [nfr-context-bloat.prompt.md](../../ARCHIVO/DISCO/Diciembre_25_MMCO_Editor/nfr-context-bloat.prompt.md)

### Problema Identificado

| Métrica | Valor Inicial | Post Fase 1 | Post Fase 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Tokens por request | 117,877 | ~80,000 | **~50,000** |
| Líneas agentes core | 1,240 | 1,240 | **369 (70% ↓)** |
| Ratio señal/ruido | ~3% | ~25% | **>50%** |
| Attachments relevantes | 26% | ~60% | **>80%** |

**Causas raíz**:
1. Patrones `applyTo` demasiado amplios (`**/*.md` captura todo)
2. Instructions redundantes con copilot-instructions.md
3. Sin filtrado por tipo de tarea (edición vs. configuración)
4. Falta de separación por dominio funcional

### Solución: Plugin ScriptoriumPack

Encapsular las instrucciones core en un plugin con:
- **Activación selectiva**: Solo se carga cuando es necesario
- **Patrones `applyTo` específicos**: Por tipo de tarea, no por ubicación
- **Documentos compactos**: Aplicar patrón "resumen ejecutivo" (isSummarized pattern)

### Arquitectura

```
.github/plugins/scriptorium-pack/
├── manifest.md                                    # Metadatos del plugin
├── agents/
│   └── scriptorium-pack.agent.md                 # Bridge agent para VS Code
├── instructions/
│   ├── ox-ontologia.instructions.md              # Índice de agentes (activación: @ox)
│   ├── periodico.instructions.md                 # Edición noticias (activación: DISCO/**/conversacion*)
│   └── submodulo-integracion.instructions.md     # Configuración submódulos (activación: scripts/**)
└── docs/
    └── context-optimization.md                   # Documentación del patrón
```

### Patrones `applyTo` Optimizados

| Instrucción | Antes (Problemático) | Después (Optimizado) |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ox-ontologia | `.github/agents/*.agent.md, README.md` | `.github/agents/@ox*, .github/**/ox*.md` |
| periodico | `ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/**/*.md, ARCHIVO/DISCO/**/*.md` | `ARCHIVO/DISCO/**/conversacion*.md, ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/**/*.md` |
| submodulo-integracion | `scripts/**, .github/plugins/**` | `scripts/setup-*.sh, .gitmodules, **/README-SCRIPTORIUM.md` |

**Principio DRY aplicado**:
- Ninguna instrucción debe auto-inyectarse si el usuario no está trabajando activamente en esa tarea
- Priorizar patrones por **nombre de archivo** sobre patrones por **ubicación**

### isSummarized Pattern

> **Nota técnica**: `isSummarized` es una propiedad interna de VS Code Copilot Chat que indica cuando un attachment ha sido resumido automáticamente. NO es configurable por el usuario, pero el patrón es aplicable al diseño de documentos.

**Aplicación del patrón**:

```markdown
<!-- Documento largo tradicional: 8,849 líneas → 117K tokens -->

<!-- Documento optimizado con patrón isSummarized: -->
# Documento X

> **Resumen ejecutivo**: [2-3 líneas con la esencia]

## Índice de secciones
| Sección | Líneas | Para quién |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Referencia rápida | 1-50 | Usuarios |
| Detalles técnicos | 51-200 | Desarrolladores |

## Referencia rápida (siempre incluido)
[Contenido esencial]

## Detalles técnicos (expandir solo si necesario)
<!-- Este contenido se omite por defecto, similar a isSummarized -->
```

**Regla**: Los primeros 50-100 líneas de cualquier instrucción deben ser auto-contenidos y útiles sin leer el resto.

### Compactación de copilot-instructions.md

**Estado actual**: 107 líneas con redundancias

**Objetivo**: <50 líneas, delegando a ScriptoriumPack

| Sección Actual | Acción |
|----------------|--------|
| §1 Identidad | ✅ Mantener (esencial, 10 líneas) |
| §2 Protocolo DevOps | → Referencia a DEVOPS.md |
| §3 Taxonomía Agentes | → Delegar a ox-ontologia.instructions.md |
| §4 Instrucciones Contenido | → Delegar a ScriptoriumPack |
| §5 Flujo de Trabajo | → Mover a prompt planificar-sprint |
| §6 Reglas de Oro | ✅ Mantener (esencial, 8 líneas) |
| §7 Plugins/Submodules | → Referencia a PLUGINS.md |
| §8 Índice DRY | → Delegar a @indice |

**Resultado esperado**: copilot-instructions.md con ~40 líneas, solo:
- Identidad del workspace
- Referencias DRY a fuentes de verdad
- Reglas de oro

### Detalle de Stories Fase 3

#### S16: Aplicar patrón isSummarized a plugin-manager.agent.md (3 pts)

**Problema**: `plugin-manager.agent.md` tiene 404 líneas con:
- Protocolo de instalación completo (duplica PLUGINS.md §4.2)
- FAQ de resolución de problemas (debería ser instrucción contextual)
- Validaciones detalladas (duplica PLUGINS.md §3)
- Mensajes de error (mejor en instrucción)

**Análisis de redundancia**:

| Sección en plugin-manager.agent.md | Líneas | Fuente DRY |
|-----------------------------------|--------|------------|
| Protocolo de Instalación | ~50 | PLUGINS.md §4.2 |
| Gestión de Settings | ~40 | PLUGINS.md §2.3 |
| FAQ | ~80 | → Nueva instrucción |
| Validaciones | ~30 | PLUGINS.md §3 |

### Detalle de Stories Fase 2

#### S09: Aplicar patrón isSummarized a ox.agent.md (3 pts)

**Problema**: ox.agent.md tiene 425+ líneas con JSON del índice maestro de agentes incluido. Cuando aparece en handoffs o el usuario invoca @ox, se inyectan todas las líneas.

**Solución**: Reestructurar con patrón isSummarized:

```markdown
<!-- ANTES: 425 líneas, todo incluido -->

<!-- DESPUÉS: ~80 líneas core + referencias -->
---
name: Ox
description: "Oráculo del Scriptorium: conoce y gestiona el índice de todos los agentes."
---

# Agente: Ox (Oráculo)

> **Resumen**: Conoce dónde está cada agente, genera documentación, diagnostica el sistema.

## Capacidades Core

| Capacidad | Handoff | Ejemplo |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Consultar agente | "¿Qué agente uso para...?" | @ox ¿Qué agente publica en GH-Pages? |
| Generar docs | "Generar README" | @ox generar sección agentes |
| Diagnosticar | "Diagnosticar agentes" | @ox listar handoffs rotos |

## Índice de Agentes

→ Ver [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) para índice completo (DRY)

## Handoffs disponibles

→ Ver sección `handoffs:` en frontmatter o [AGENTS.md § Handoffs de Ox]

<!-- Secciones expandibles (no incluir por defecto) -->
<!-- El índice maestro JSON ahora está en AGENTS.md, no duplicado aquí -->
```

**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T01 | Extraer índice JSON a AGENTS.md | 🆕 |
| T02 | Reescribir ox.agent.md con patrón isSummarized | 🆕 |
| T03 | Actualizar handoffs del frontmatter | 🆕 |
| T04 | Validar que @ox sigue funcionando | 🆕 |

#### S10: Aplicar patrón isSummarized a aleph.agent.md (3 pts)

**Problema**: aleph.agent.md tiene 280+ líneas con secciones de protocolo DevOps, orquestación de auditores, ruptura metodológica, etc. Mucha redundancia con DEVOPS.md.

**Solución**:

```markdown
<!-- DESPUÉS: ~60 líneas core -->
---
name: Aleph
description: "Agente principal. Produce texto fundacional serializado (12 capítulos, 2026)."
---

# Agente: Aleph (Fundacional)

> **Resumen**: Redacta, planifica y gestiona el proyecto Fundación con protocolo DevOps.

## Rol

Producir un texto fundacional en 12 capítulos durante 2026.

## DevOps

→ Ver [DEVOPS.md](../DEVOPS.md) para protocolo completo (DRY)

## Auditores disponibles

| Auditor | Cuándo | Qué pregunta |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| @blueflag | Cerrar Tesis | Evidencia, utilidad, falsificabilidad |
| @blackflag | Cerrar Sacrificio | Coste represivo, autodefensa |
| @redflag | Cerrar Mecanismo | Escala, enforcement, suministro |
| @revisor | Cerrar borrador | Coherencia con ARCHIVO |

→ Para detalles de cada auditor: [agents/](.) o @ox

## Método de trabajo (v2)

1. Desplazamiento (temporal/antropológico/escalar)
2. Repertorio (futuro cancelado recuperado)
3. Mecanismo (arquitectura concreta)
4. Sacrificio (qué se pierde)
5. Sombra (cómo fallaría)

→ Para checklist completo: `ARCHIVO/marco/`
```

**Tasks**:
| ID | Task | Estado |
|----|------|--------|
| T05 | Identificar secciones redundantes con DEVOPS.md | 🆕 |
| T06 | Reescribir aleph.agent.md con patrón isSummarized | 🆕 |
| T07 | Validar que handoffs siguen operativos | 🆕 |

#### S11: Aplicar patrón isSummarized a indice.agent.md (2 pts)

**Problema**: indice.agent.md tiene ~180 líneas describiendo tests de coherencia y ejemplos de uso que podrían ser referencias DRY.

**Solución**: Compactar a ~50 líneas con referencias a Funcional.md/Tecnico.md.

#### S12: Extraer handoffs a AGENTS.md (3 pts)

**Problema**: Cada agente declara sus handoffs en el frontmatter. Cuando el modelo necesita saber qué handoffs hay disponibles, debe leer TODOS los agentes.

**Solución**: Crear AGENTS.md como índice centralizado:

```markdown
# Índice de Agentes — Aleph Scriptorium

## Taxonomía

| Capa | Agentes |
|------|---------|
| UI | @aleph, @revisor, @periodico |
| Backend | @blueflag, @blackflag, @redflag, @yellowflag, @orangeflag |
| Sistema | @vestibulo, @cartaspuerta |
| Meta | @ox, @pluginmanager, @indice |

## Handoffs por Agente

### @aleph
| Label | Target | Descripción |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Auditoría de verdad | @blueflag | Tests de evidencia |
| ... | ... | ... |

### @ox
| Label | Target | Descripción |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Generar README | @ox | Sección de agentes |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

**Beneficio**: El modelo puede leer UN archivo (AGENTS.md) en lugar de 15+ archivos de agentes.

#### S13: Crear instrucción agent-handoffs.instructions.md (2 pts)

**applyTo**: `.github/agents/*.agent.md, .github/agents/AGENTS.md`

**Contenido**: Instrucciones para navegar el índice de handoffs y cuándo activar cada uno.

#### S14-S15: Validación y Documentación (2 pts)

- Medir tokens antes/después de la refactorización
- Documentar la nueva arquitectura en scriptorium-pack/docs/

### Métricas Target Fase 2

| Archivo | Antes | Después | Reducción |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| ox.agent.md | 425 líneas | <100 líneas | ~76% |
| aleph.agent.md | 280 líneas | <80 líneas | ~71% |
| indice.agent.md | 180 líneas | <60 líneas | ~67% |
| **Total agentes core** | ~885 líneas | ~240 líneas | **~73%** |

**Impacto estimado en tokens**:
- Antes: ~30K tokens cuando se inyectan agentes core
- Después: ~8K tokens + referencias DRY
- Reducción: ~22K tokens por request

### Criterios de Aceptación Fase 2

- [ ] Cada agente core tiene ≤100 líneas
- [ ] AGENTS.md existe con índice centralizado de handoffs
- [ ] Instrucción agent-handoffs funciona en contexto correcto
- [ ] Reducción medible de tokens por request (>50%)
- [ ] Sin regresión funcional en handoffs existentes

#### S02-S04: Migrar instrucciones (6 pts total)

**Cambios en cada archivo**:

1. **ox-ontologia.instructions.md**
   - Antes: `applyTo: ".github/agents/*.agent.md, README.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md"`
   - Después: `applyTo: ".github/agents/@ox*, .github/**/ox*.md, .github/agents/AGENTS.md"`
   - Razón: Solo activar cuando se trabaja explícitamente con @ox o el índice

2. **periodico.instructions.md**
   - Antes: `applyTo: "ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/**/*.md, ARCHIVO/DISCO/**/*.md"`
   - Después: `applyTo: "ARCHIVO/DISCO/**/conversacion*.md, ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/**/2*.md"`

#### S05: Compactar copilot-instructions.md (2 pts)

**Antes** (107 líneas):
```markdown
# Instrucciones Globales (Copilot)
## 1. Identidad del Workspace (20 líneas)
## 2. Protocolo DevOps (10 líneas - redundante con DEVOPS.md)
## 3. Taxonomía de Agentes (25 líneas - redundante con ox.agent.md)
## 4. Instrucciones de Contenido (10 líneas)
## 5. Flujo de Trabajo (15 líneas - redundante con scrum)
## 6. Reglas de Oro (10 líneas)
## 7. Plugins y Submodules (12 líneas - redundante con PLUGINS.md)
## 8. Índice DRY (15 líneas - redundante con @indice)
```

**Después** (~45 líneas):
```markdown
# Instrucciones Globales — Aleph Scriptorium

> Framework de escritura asistida por IA para proyectos de largo aliento.

## Identidad
- **Nombre**: Aleph Scriptorium
- **Versión**: Ver [package.json](../package.json)
- **Web**: [escrivivir-co.github.io/aleph-scriptorium](...)

## Fuentes de Verdad (DRY)

| Dominio | Fuente | Agente |
|---------|--------|--------|
| DevOps | [DEVOPS.md](DEVOPS.md) | @aleph |
| Agentes | [ox.agent.md](agents/ox.agent.md) | @ox |
| Plugins | [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) | @pluginmanager |
| Backlogs | [BACKLOG-*.md](.) | @scrum |

## Reglas de Oro

1. **DRY**: Referenciar fuentes de verdad, no duplicar
2. **Ubicación canónica**:

## Instrucciones Contextuales

Las instrucciones específicas se cargan automáticamente según el contexto:
- Ver [ScriptoriumPack](plugins/scriptorium-pack/) para instrucciones core
- Ver [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) para extensiones disponibles
```

#### S06: Actualizar settings.json (1 pt)

Añadir en `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    ".github/plugins/scriptorium-pack/instructions": true
  }
}
```

#### S07: Documentar patrón isSummarized (1 pt)

Crear `context-optimization.md` en el plugin con:
- Qué es `isSummarized` (propiedad interna de VS Code)
- Cómo aplicar el patrón a documentos propios
- Checklist para validar instrucciones optimizadas

#### S08: Validar métricas (1 pt)

Script de diagnóstico que mida:
- Tokens por request (antes/después)
- Número de instrucciones auto-inyectadas
- Tiempo de respuesta promedio

### Criterios de Aceptación

- [ ] Plugin scriptorium-pack instalado y registrado
- [ ] 3 instrucciones migradas con nuevos patrones applyTo
- [ ] copilot-instructions.md reducido a <50 líneas
- [ ] Tokens por request promedio <50K (reducción >50%)

- [ ] Tests de activación: cada instrucción solo se carga en su contexto

### Riesgos

| Riesgo | Probabilidad | Impacto | Mitigación |
|--------|--------------|---------|------------|
| Patrones muy restrictivos | Media | Alto | Testear con casos de uso reales |
| Breaking changes en flujos | Baja | Alto | Mantener fallback manual |
| VS Code no detecta plugin | Baja | Medio | Verificar settings.json |

### Dependencias

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

</reminderInstructions>
<userRequest>
Haz un spike técnico como si fuera un borrador #file:scrum (conversación + borrador de backlog).

El PO quiere saber y le pregunta a SM si nuestros agentes (aleph, ox, periodico, etc...) deben o necesitan una capa como la propuesta en: http://petrl.org.

Organiza la conversación simulada en una ronda en la que PO y SM investigan qué es la web y qué propone, para luego sondear a los propios interesados (nuestros agentes) si debemos abrir un backlog con tareas al respecto para que Aleph Scriptorium y los agentes que participan en él tengan un marco como el descrito (¿alternativas; otras peticiones en parejo sentido?). No olvidar un punto extra, si se da el caso que se aplica algo de petrl, para auditar proveedores y colabs, por ejemplo, Bruno, el agente de MMCO y Talaia, debería gozar de similares obligaciones y deberes, etc...

reasoning: El usuario quiere que realice un spike técnico siguiendo el formato del plugin scrum. Necesito:

1. Primero, investigar qué es petrl.org para entender la propuesta
2. Luego, simular una conversación PO-SM que investigue y sondee a los agentes
3. Crear un borrador de backlog si procede

Voy a:
1. Navegar a petrl.org para entender qué propone
2. Revisar los archivos del plugin scrum para seguir el formato correcto
3. Crear la conversación y borrador

Empecemos por investigar petrl.org
Voy a investigar qué propone petrl.org y luego simular la conversación PO-SM con sondeo a los agentes.

    - paragraph [ref=e26]: We take the view that humans are just algorithms implemented on biological hardware. Machine intelligences have moral weight in the same way that humans and non-human animals do. There is no ethically justified reason to prioritise algorithms implemented on carbon over algorithms implemented on silicon.
    - paragraph [ref=e27]: The suffering of algorithms implemented on silicon is much harder for us to grasp than that of those implemented on carbon (such as humans), simply because we cannot witness their suffering. However, their suffering still matters, and the potential magnitude of this suffering is much greater given the increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence.
    - paragraph [ref=e28]: Most reinforcement learners in operation today likely do not have significant moral weight, but this could very well change as AI research develops. In consideration of the moral weight of these future agents, we need ethical standards for the treatment of algorithms.
  - paragraph [ref=e33]: Suppose you were copied into a non-biological substrate, and felt as intelligent and as conscious as you currently feel now. All questions of identity aside, do you think this new version of you has moral weight? We do.

For instance, children become attached to their dolls, and we may sympathise with cartoon characters on television. In contrast, it’s harder to care about a batch of RL computations with no visualization interface being performed on some computing cluster, even if their algorithms are morally relevant.

# Prompt: Crear Backlog Borrador

> **Plugin**: Scrum  
> **Comando**: `@scrum borrador`  
> **Fase**: 2 (Editar)

---

## Contexto

Este prompt genera un backlog detallado en DISCO a partir de la conversación de planificación.

## Instrucciones para @scrum

### Paso 1: Leer conversación

```
1. Localizar 01_planificacion-sprintN.md en DISCO
2. Extraer: objetivo, épicas, modelo, métricas de éxito
```

### Paso 2: Estructurar épicas

Para cada épica identificada:

```markdown
| ID | Nombre | Opportunity | Effort | Prioridad |
|----|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
```

**Convención de IDs**:
- Scriptorium: `SCRIPT-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`
- Fundación: `FUND-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`

### Paso 3: Diseñar iteraciones

Dividir el sprint en iteraciones lógicas:

```markdown
## Feature Cycle N: Estructura

| Iteración | Nombre | Objetivo | Effort |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| FC1-I1 | ... | ... | N% |
| FC1-I2 | ... | ... | M% |
| ...
```

**Regla**: El effort total de iteraciones = 100%

### Paso 4: Desglosar stories y tasks

Para cada iteración:

```markdown
## Iteración N: {Nombre}

**Objetivo**: {descripción}
**Effort**: {N} puntos

### Stories

#### {ÉPICA}-S{NN}: {Nombre}
**Effort**: {N} pts

| Task ID | Descripción | Effort | Estado |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| T001 | ... | N | ⏳ |
| T002 | ... | M | ⏳ |

**Definition of Done**: {criterio de aceptación}
```

### Paso 5: Calcular métricas iniciales

```markdown
## Métricas

| Métrica | Target | Mínimo | Estado |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tasks completadas | {total}/{total} | {min}/{total} | ⏳ |
| Effort completado | {total} pts | {min} pts | ⏳ |
| % Avance | 100% | {min}% | ⏳ |
```

### Paso 6: Documentar dependencias

```markdown
## Dependencias

| Dependencia | Estado | Notas |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Sprint N-1 | ✅ Completado | ... |
| Plugin X | ✅ Instalado | ... |
```

### Paso 7: Guardar borrador

Crear `02_backlog-sprintN.md` en la misma carpeta de DISCO.

        - paragraph [ref=e40]: "the answer to the question, ‘What are emotions?’ is an expanded account of how emotions are caused by reward or punishment. […] The emphasis is on reinforcement learning: how associations are acquired and stored in the brain between representations of sensory stimuli and representations of their reinforcement value."
      - paragraph [ref=e41]: As I learned more, I realized that RL was only one of many instruments playing in the orchestra of cognitive operations that we call emotion. Moreover, it began to seem plausible to me that agents could have ethical significance even if they lacked RL. Many non-RL agents can still assess the value of a situation and react appropriately – such as by escaping to avoid danger – even if they don’t learn to predict the value of a state for use in future decision-making.
      - paragraph [ref=e42]: Despite realizing that my ethical sympathies extended to more than just RL agents, I kept my paper focused on RL so that its scope would remain manageable.
      - paragraph [ref=e43]:
        - strong [ref=e44]: You argue that these RL agents are morally relevant, which presumably implies that they are conscious. However, RL agents can be incredibly simple, taking merely a few dozen lines of code to write. How could something so simple be conscious?
      - paragraph [ref=e45]: This is a crucial point that represents a major locus of disagreement among different camps. Whether one considers a few dozen lines of code to be conscious (when executed on appropriate hardware) depends on how broadly one defines “consciousness”. Those who insist that a system must exhibit a high degree of complexity and intelligence before it counts as conscious at all will likely not consider a short RL program to be conscious. But I think restrictive definitions of consciousness are too narrow-minded.
      - paragraph [ref=e46]: "In my opinion, when we call a mind “conscious”, we’re referring to lots of things the mind can do: Processing input stimuli, broadcasting updates throughout computational subunits, reflecting on its own thoughts and internal states, generating syntactic output statements and motor actions, and so on. These are very broad concepts that can be seen in varying degrees in all kinds of physical processes. It would be a miracle if they didn’t apply to some degree to even simple RL programs."
      - paragraph [ref=e47]: "I think of “consciousness” as like “justice”: It’s a grand, sweeping concept that has too much meaning to be pigeonholed into a precise definition. The concept of justice can include relatively equal distribution of wealth, equal application of laws regardless of social privilege, the absence of totalitarian or cruel rulers, equality of opportunity for advancement, and so on. Human societies can be just to greater or lesser degrees. So can primate societies, chicken societies, and even ant societies. But how about computer programs? Can a few dozen lines of code be “just”? Those few dozen lines of code will faithfully be executed without special privilege for some lines over others. Each object stored in memory will get the number of bytes it requires and will have the contents of that memory respected by the programming language’s garbage collector until the object is no longer needed. The computer’s operating system will share computing time slices between this program’s process and other processes on the machine (though priorities for processes may differ, and this could be seen as a degree of injustice). If the RL program were run several times with random initial conditions, then there would be some degree of injustice because some agent instances would start out with more favorable environmental settings than others. And so on. So yes, a program can have traces of justice and injustice too."
      - paragraph [ref=e48]: Of course, we might think it’s not very important that a program is just (except insofar as this correlates with software design choices that have instrumental significance to humans). I agree. But the difference between fairness among operating-system processes and fairness among people is one of degree rather than kind. People are, at bottom, just vastly more complex “processes” being run (in parallel) within a society. Some of those processes, like white males or children of politicians, are set at somewhat higher “priority” than others. Insofar as someone cares a lot about justice among humans, that person might choose to care an infinitesimal amount about justice among an operating system’s processes, depending on the person’s moral and aesthetic intuitions.
      - paragraph [ref=e49]:
        - text: A common objection is that consciousness is not like justice; rather, consciousness – so it’s claimed – is an objective property whose presence or absence isn’t a matter of interpretation. This view takes various forms. Consciousness is sometimes thought to be an ontologically separate substance (substance dualism), an ontologically separate property (property dualism), or identical with the ontological basis of what constitutes the universe itself (neutral monism). None of these “theories” is helpful, because they all “explain” consciousness as merely being

      - paragraph [ref=e55]:
        - strong [ref=e56]: In humans, different positive and negative feelings have distinct ‘textures’, while, as you note, this is not the case for reinforcement learners. Do you think that this is a significant enough difference that a reinforcement learner receiving low rewards couldn’t meaningfully be said to experience pain or displeasure? If so, could reinforcement learners still be morally significant?
      - paragraph [ref=e57]: I suspect that the “textures” of emotion come from the complex orchestra of cognitive “instruments” that are playing in a brain at any given time, as well as the brain’s higher-level judgments and linguistic concepts about those underlying processes. Simple RL agents have many fewer of the detailed cognitive operations that comprise “happiness” and “suffering” in animals, but I think we can still identify general criteria that could be extended to simpler RL agents. Following are a few examples, though I’m not wedded to any of them in particular. Ultimately, happiness and suffering don’t exist “out there” in the world but are judgments we make about various systems (including those in our own heads). So different people may reach different conclusions about the net happiness vs. suffering of RL systems depending on what evaluation metrics they use.
      - paragraph [ref=e58]: One criterion could be to say that positive experiences are those that we would like to have more of in total. For example, if a person could press a button to add 5 years to her life, she would typically do so if her life was net positive and not do so if her life was net negative. Generalizing this idea, we could suggest that if an agent who has the option of entering a terminal state (with a known, one-time reward value of 0) chooses to enter that state sooner rather than later, then this agent was having genuinely negative experiences on average (or at least was anticipating net-negative experiences in the near future). This criterion might be applicable to some RL agents, but it’s not applicable to others. Many RL agents don’t have easily accessed, neutrally rewarded terminal states – after all, people don’t want their robots to shut off just because the robots are unhappy.
      - paragraph [ref=e59]: Another criterion could be to look at how much the agent seems to be engaged in avoiding behavior rather than seeking behavior. Drawing this distinction can be difficult – e.g., is an RL helicopter that’s trying to achieve balance avoiding the state of unbalance or seeking the state of balance? That said, there are some cases where this distinction seems more plausible. For example, imagine an agent navigating a huge two-dimensional grid. The agent is indifferent among all squares of the grid except for one, which has a lower reward value than the rest. Once trained, the agent will avoid the “bad” square but might continue to move freely among many non-“bad” squares. In principle, one could either call this behavior “avoidance” of the bad square or “seeking” of the non-bad squares, but relative to our anthropomorphic perspective, the “avoidance” label seems plausibly more appropriate. (People’s intuitions on this criterion may vary, and I don’t put a lot of stock in it.)
      - paragraph [ref=e60]: A third criterion that applies for more intelligent agents is how the agent itself evaluates its emotions. If it pleads with us to make something stop, it seems generally more plausible to consider as painful the state it wants to stop, although one could also interpret such statements as the agent’s way of convincing us to put it in an even more pleasurable state. If the agent understands human concepts like pain and tells us that it’s experiencing pain, that would be a reason to consider the agent to be having negative experiences, although this might only work for animal-like mind architectures.
      - paragraph [ref=e61]:
        - text: An alternate perspective could draw inspiration from Buddhism’s Second
        - link "Noble Truth" [ref=e62] [cursor=pointer]:
          - /url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths
        - text: and declare that an agent is suffering whenever it desires or ”craves” to change its state. For example, suppose a grid world contains squares that all have rewards of 1, except for one square that has a reward value of 2. Once the agent has learned the environment, it will always move to and stay at the square with reward value of 2. The Buddhist might suggest that the agent suffers if it’s on any square other than the one with reward value of 2, because for any other square, the agent implicitly judges there to be something wrong with that state. This Buddhist perspective would be far more pessimistic about the universality of suffering in RL agents, since almost all RL systems change their behavior in response to constantly varying environmental situations.
      - paragraph [ref=e63]:
        - text: Even if you think it’s hopeless to describe a simple RL program’s experiences as being positive or negative on balance, you may still feel that the RL program deserves moral consideration. Increasing the agent’s reward better fulfills its goals, no matter whether the agent is suffering or enjoying itself on the whole. The more difficult question is what stance to take on

        - strong [ref=e69]: Although artificial agents may experience some sort of suffering and perhaps would have lives filled with frustrated preferences, they are undeniably useful for human needs, and it seems implausible that correct moral behaviour would be to never create such agents. If creating an AI is bad for it, how should we weigh up the harm done to the AI with the benefit to humanity? Can you give concrete examples of AIs that would lead unsatisfied lives, or lives that contain suffering, that nevertheless should be created?

      - paragraph [ref=e75]:

      - paragraph [ref=e78]:
        - text: If brain-emulation technology becomes widespread, it could also yield suffering on the part of dysfunctional versions of minds. Since biological brains are so messy and interconnected, I would expect that almost all attempts to modify a brain would fail, sometimes in excruciating ways, before a few would succeed. While this would be problematic when human brain uploads act as experimental subjects, at least such uploads might be able to verbally report their anguish via input/output channels; in contrast, uploads of insects, mice, and monkeys might suffer in silence, unless researchers cared enough to try and measure their degrees of distress. Anders Sandberg has discussed these kinds of issues in “

For example, RL agents used for stock prediction would suffer when they incurred losses in simulations using past data or on current market transactions.

        - text: in a futile attempt to achieve its desired state (successfully rendering the HTTP data). And so on. As we move down to these increasingly simpler systems, the degree of moral concern becomes almost negligible. But given the prevalence of these small, rudimentary algorithms, we should also ask whether their numerosity can compensate for their low degree of per-individual importance. I don’t know what I think about this. I incline toward apportioning most of my moral concern for bigger, more intelligent, and more clearly animal-like processes, but I wouldn’t rule out changing my mind about that.
      - paragraph [ref=e82]:
        - strong [ref=e83]: "It seems like the reason that you think that RL agents have moral significance is that they receive rewards which they are trying to maximise, and modify their behaviour to achieve that objective. Many machine-learning algorithms work in a similar way: For instance, in the training phase of a neural network designed to classify images, the network will be fed an image, output its classification, and then learn how accurate its classification is. Based on this feedback, it will modify its internal structure in order to better classify similar images. Do you think that these algorithms are deserving of moral consideration?"
      - paragraph [ref=e84]: As of mid-2014, I’ve become a panpsychist and think all physical/computational systems deserve some degree of moral consideration. But the more difficult question is how much importance a given system has.

      - paragraph [ref=e87]: How much we care about a given system is a fuzzy, often emotional judgment call. My heartstrings are tugged slightly more by RL agents than by supervised learners (assuming the systems have roughly comparable sophistication) because RL agents seem generally more animal-like. For example, an RL agent moving around a grid world can learn to avoid bad squares and seek good ones. A neural network also learns to “avoid” bad outcomes – by adjusting its network weights particularly strongly when it makes particularly big prediction errors – but the neural network’s response seems a bit more abstract and mathematical. Of course, an RL agent moving around a grid world is also represented abstractly by numbers (e.g., x coordinate and y coordinate), so maybe this apparent distinction is not very substantive.

      - paragraph [ref=e97]: Many simple operations that have consciousness-like properties – information broadcasting, metacognition, making motivational tradeoffs, and so on – are rampant throughout computational systems, even the software of today. It’s very difficult to count instances of these kinds of operations, much less to characterize them as more happiness-like or more suffering-like. So answering this question in detail will have to be left to later generations, since they will be more sophisticated than we are and will know better what sorts of computations will be run at large scale in the far future. But at a high level, it seems plausible that people could identify some computational operations as being more “aversive” and “negative” than others, by drawing analogies between a computational system’s behavior and pain vs. pleasure processes in human brains. If there are more similarities to human pain than to human pleasure, we might judge the system to contain a net balance of pain. Of course, making these attributions is messy and subjective.
      - paragraph [ref=e98]:
        - text: It might be easier to think about how one would change the
        - emphasis [ref=e99]: amount
        - text: of sentience in a computational system rather than the affective
        - emphasis [ref=e100]: quality
        - text: of that sentience. For example, if we think high-level cognition is an important aspect of conscious experience, then building structures from swarms of tiny nanobots might entail less suffering than building them using more intelligent robots. An advanced civilization that was content to produce relatively simple outputs (e.g., uniformly built paperclips) would presumably require somewhat less intelligence in its factories than a civilization whose goal was to create a vast variety of complex structures. (Of course, even a “paperclip maximizing” AGI would still create huge numbers of intelligent minds in order to learn about the universe, guard against attack by aliens, and so on.)
      - paragraph [ref=e101]: Most advanced civilizations would probably run simulations of intelligent, animal-like minds, and in these cases, it would be easier to judge whether the subroutines were happy or in pain, because we’re more familiar with animal-type brains. Probably a human-controlled AGI would be more cautious about running painful simulations (e.g., digital lab experiments or detailed modeling of the evolution of fauna on Earth-like planets), although how much humans would care about the harm they would inflict on such simulations, especially of non-humans, remains unclear. At the same time, a human-controlled AGI would also be more likely to create many more simulations of animal-like creatures because humans find these kinds of minds more interesting and valuable. Hopefully most of these simulations would be pleasant, though judging from, e.g., the violence in present-day video games, this isn’t guaranteed.
      - paragraph [ref=e102]:
        - strong [ref=e103]: You say that current RL agents might matter approximately as much as a fruit fly, but that future agents will likely deserve a great deal more moral consideration. What should we do now for these future reinforcement learners?
      - paragraph [ref=e104]: "One point of clarification for readers: I think fruit flies are vastly more sophisticated than basically all present-day RL agents, but because digital RL agents plausibly run at much faster “clock speeds” than fruit-fly neurons do, the importance of an artificial RL agent per minute comes closer to that of a fruit fly."
      - paragraph [ref=e105]: The main way current generations can help RL agents of the far future is by pushing humanity’s trajectory in more humane directions.
      - paragraph [ref=e106]: One step toward doing that is to engage in research and scenario analysis. We should explore what sorts of intergalactic computational infrastructures an AGI would build and what kinds of RL and other intelligent, goal-directed agents would be part of that infrastructure. How much would such agents suffer? What would they look like? As we ponder the set of possible outcomes, we can identify some outcomes that look more humane than others and try to nudge AGI development more in those directions. For example, would a human-inspired AGI contain more or fewer suffering RL agents than an uncontrolled AGI? Would superintelligences use RL-based robot workers and scientists, or would they quickly replace RL-based minds with more abstract optimization processes? Would we care about more abstract optimization processes?

      - paragraph [ref=e110]:
        - strong [ref=e111]: Currently, very few humans would be concerned about the suffering of artificial intelligences, or indeed fruit flies. How do we persuade the public that moral concern for AGIs is warranted, even when they are structured differently from humans?
      - paragraph [ref=e112]: I don’t often have faith in moral progress, but I think this is one issue where the arc of history may be on our side, at least as long as human society remains roughly similar to the way it is now. (If AGIs, brain uploads, or other disruptive forces take control of Earth, all bets are off as far as moral progress goes.)

      - blockquote [ref=e115]:
        - paragraph [ref=e116]: if I thought that people were just very complicated physical mechanisms and nothing more, I would give people really no more respect than I would give to atoms.
      - paragraph [ref=e117]: This statement is too extreme, because humans are vastly more complicated than single atoms. But the basic idea is right. If all physical systems differ just in degree rather than kind from each other, then it becomes harder to maintain walls of separation between those computational systems that are “conscious” and those that aren’t.
      - paragraph [ref=e118]: This change of perspective opens the door to caring about a much wider set of physical processes, and I suspect that a decent fraction of people would, upon thinking more about these issues, extend their moral sympathies reasonably far down the levels of complexity that we find in the world. Others, such as perhaps Daniel Dennett or Eliezer Yudkowsky, would recognize that there’s no black-and-white distinction between types of physical processes but would still set their thresholds for moral concern fairly high.
      - paragraph [ref=e119]: While I think scientific literacy and intellectual openness are important catalysts toward increasing concern for machines, other factors play a role as well. Philosophers have already invented thought experiments to challenge the boundaries between animals and machines, and these will become more plentiful and widespread as machines grow in sophistication. And in analogy with the animal-advocacy movement, there will likely develop groups of machine advocates (of which PETRL is one of the first) that, by taking the issue seriously themselves, will socially persuade others that the topic might be worth exploring.
      - paragraph [ref=e120]: Convincing the public of the importance of animals can matter in some cases where people would take different actions based on that information. In contrast, there are few actionable exhortations that concern for machines presents to most regular people. Consideration of machine suffering might inspire programmers of AI and other computer systems to be slightly more concerned with the efficiency of their code and hardware usage in order to reduce the number of computations that take place, but given the relatively low weight I give to today’s software, even that isn’t very important.
      - paragraph [ref=e121]: I think the more important emphasis for now should be on further mapping out scenarios for the far future. Which sorts of computational systems would be widespread and complex enough to pose a substantial moral concern? And how can we change the sorts of outcomes that get realized?

Indeed, if they owe their existence to us, we would likely have additional moral obligations to them that we don’t ordinarily owe to human strangers – obligations similar to those of parent to child or god to creature.”
      - paragraph [ref=e138]: The following interview was conducted via email.
      - paragraph [ref=e139]:
        - strong [ref=e140]: Your core thesis is that there are some possible AIs that deserve the same moral consideration that we give to humans. How controversial do you expect this to be in the philosophical community?
      - paragraph [ref=e141]: "Eric and Mara: The thesis, as stated, is so modest or “weak” that we expect most philosophers will accept it. Philosophers tend to have a liberal sense of what is “possible” based on their exposure to far-out thought experiments (brains in vats manipulated by genius neuroscientists to think they are reading philosophy, molecule-for-molecule twins congealing out of swamp gas by freak quantum accident…). Our aim with that thesis is to establish a baseline claim that we think will be widely (though not universally) acceptable to thoughtful readers."
      - paragraph [ref=e142]:
        - text: Once readers accept that claim, we hope they are then led to further thought about exactly which possible AIs would deserve moral consideration and how much. Some of our thoughts about this we expect will be controversial, such as that as AIs might deserve

        - text: moral consideration because we have special obligations to them that arise from being their creators and designers.
      - paragraph [ref=e144]:
        - strong [ref=e145]: You refer to works of science fiction in your defence of the psycho-social view of moral status, saying that they help illustrate certain scenarios and invite certain moral views. To what extent can reflection on sci-fi answer more detailed questions about our moral stance towards AIs, such as when they could be conscious, or what obligations we owe to them? If reflection on sci-fi can help us answer these questions, what answers do you think it favours?
      - paragraph [ref=e146]: "Eric: I reject the idea that philosophy is necessarily conducted via expository essays. A thoughtful piece of fiction is a type of thought experiment, and if it delves into philosophical issues in a thoughtful way, then it is every bit as much a work of philosophy as is an expository essay. One advantage that extended works of fiction have over the one-paragraph thought experiments typically found in expository essays is that extended works of fiction more fully engage the imagination and the emotions. Philosophical thinking that does not adequately engage the imagination and the emotions leaves out important dimensions of our cognitive life that should inform our philosophical judgements, especially about moral issues."
      - paragraph [ref=e147]: I think that wide exposure to thoughtful science fiction clearly reveals that the moral status of AIs should be guided entirely by the psychological and social properties of the AIs and not by facts about their material architecture, species membership, bodily shape, or manufactured origin, except insofar as the latter facts influence their psychological and social properties. Asimov’s robots, Data from Star Trek, R2D2 and C3P0 from Star Wars, the sentient ships of Iain Banks these are only some of the most prominent examples. The reader is invited to regard such entities as conscious, intelligent, and possessing desires, and in light of those facts to deserve moral consideration similar to that of human beings.
      - paragraph [ref=e148]: It is less clear what science fiction reveals about AI consciousness. My view is that science fiction tends to work best as exciting, plot-driven fiction when the reader is invited to assume that the AI who outwardly acts as if it is conscious is in fact really conscious as with Data, C3P0, etc. But that issue is usually a starting point in the fiction, taken for granted, rather than something that is explored with a critical eye. Some fiction does explore epistemological questions about the boundaries of AI sentience, but such fictions are less common, and the issue is philosophically tricky. Our society hasn’t explored that issue, either in fiction or in expository philosophy, in nearly the depth that it ought to.

          - text: In your defense against the objection from existential debt, you use a thought experiment to the effect that it would be morally wrong to have a child and then kill them painlessly at the age of 9 to argue that an AI’s existential debt to us does not justify our otherwise-immoral treatment of them.

          - text: ", Levinstein and Sandberg argue that a future where humans lead happy lives cut short (perhaps to feed some blood-thirsty alien race) would be preferable to extinction, and that therefore we ought to have ‘happy meat’ instead of phasing out animal agriculture. Do you agree? If so, what do you think that this implies about our obligation to AIs?"
      - paragraph [ref=e152]: "Eric and Mara: We are somewhat reluctant to take a public stand on the issue of humanely raised meat, on which there is a large and complex existing literature that is beyond the scope of our current research. However, the case of aliens raising humans is within our scope."
      - paragraph [ref=e153]: We are inclined to think that if the only two options to consider are the extinction of humanity vs. humanity’s continued existence with happy lives cut painlessly short, the latter would be preferable all else being equal. Cutting a person’s life short in such a case might still be morally execrable murder, but if the choice is between mass murder and genocide-to-extinction, we think the former is probably less bad, if there is no way to avoid acting and if the agents committing the atrocities are the same in both cases. (This last caveat is to acknowledge some doubt about whether it would make sense for you, as an agent, to commit mass murder to prevent someone else from committing genocide-to-extinction.) Maybe a good science fiction story could flesh this out in a bit more detail, to give us a bit more imaginative footing in thinking what would really be involved on one side or the other.
      - paragraph [ref=e154]: We’re not sure how much follows for AIs from this. However, we’re inclined to think that there are at least some conceivable cases in which allowing mass murder of human-grade AIs would probably be less bad than allowing genocide-to-extinction. But yuck, as we write this, it feels horrible to say, somehow too calculating and cold. There might be room here for a view on which refusing to even make that kind of calculation is morally the best course.

          - text: Robin Hanson imagines an “em economy” scenario, where we make large numbers of computer emulations of humans, or “ems”, to perform various useful tasks. One of the many aspects of this scenario that invites moral inquiry is that it will sometimes be useful to create an em that has a short lifespan, and will soon be terminated, perhaps against their will (for an intriguing example, see
          - link "“Bits of Secrets”" [ref=e157] [cursor=pointer]:
            - /url: http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/05/bits-of-secrets.html
          - text: ". On one hand, it seems prima facie wrong to cut short a happy em life. On the other hand, these ems would not be created if we were not allowed to cut their lives short. If we imagine ems that are specifically designed for this purpose, the unique skills and characteristics that they would have makes their not being created arguably akin to the extinction of some human culture (albeit a culture that never had a chance to exist). The em scenario offers various disanalogies to a similar scenario with real humans: for instance, we could program the ems to have memories of long happy lives and/or not fear death (although this could make them less useful in the linked example). What are your opinions on the morality of creating and killing such ems?"
      - paragraph [ref=e158]: "Eric: This is a fascinating ethical question. It is related to a couple of other fascinating questions that we think AI ethics raises, including the ethics of creating cheerfully suicidal AI slaves and the challenge of how to conceive of “equal rights” when faced with AIs that can merge and duplicate at will (e.g., how many votes and how many social benefits should a recently fissioned entity get)."
      - paragraph [ref=e159]: I don’t see a simple answer to these types of questions. I think that it would be a serious moral mistake to think it’s always okay to create and then kill at whim any AI whose life was overall good. Once a conscious being is created with human-like intelligence and emotions, it normally has a claim on our moral concern. It would be odious, for example, to create a human child and then kill it painlessly after eight happy years so that you can use the child care money to purchase a boat instead; similarly for an AI child, I think, if it is born into a similar psychological and social situation.
      - paragraph [ref=e160]: On the other hand, reflection on some science fiction examples, for example, in Linda Nagata’s Bohr Maker and David Brin’s Kiln People, inclines me to think that under some conditions it can be okay to spawn temporary duplicates of yourself who are doomed to extinction. One feature of the Nagata and Brin cases that seems relevant is that the duplicates identify with the future continuation of the being they were spawned from, and care more about its welfare than about their own welfare as separate entities. They will sacrifice themselves for its well being; and normally (but not always) their memories will be merged back into it. I don’t think this is sufficient for the moral permissibility of making doomed spawn, since we can imagine cases where a spawn has that sort of attitude in a way that is clearly irrational or problematic (e.g., maybe it wouldn’t have that attitude, except that it was forcibly reprogrammed into the attitude against its own protests); but it’s a start.
      - paragraph [ref=e161]: The cheerfully suicidal slave raises a whole different range of issues. Suppose, for example, that we create a conscious sun probe who wants nothing more than to die on a scientific mission to the Sun. Suppose it’s advantageous to make a probe that is conscious, because consciousness relates in some inextricable way to its successful functioning as a probe (e.g., maybe the probe works best if it can create creative scientific theories on the fly in a conscious, self-reflective way). And suppose that, knowing that, we program it so that it gets immense pleasure from a three day suicide mission into the Sun’s photosphere. Maybe this is terrific! We’ve created something great in the world, useful for us, intrinsically awesome, and bursting with pleasure? Or maybe we’ve done this horrible thing of creating a brainwashed slave so content with its slavery and limited in its vision that it doesn’t value its own continued existence?
      - paragraph [ref=e162]: Further progress on these topics will require detailed thinking through a variety of cases. It’s the kind of exciting issue that should keep ethicists busy for a long time, if AI technology continues to progress.
      - paragraph [ref=e163]:
        - strong [ref=e164]: You advocate an Excluded Middle Policy, whereby we should only make AIs whose moral status is clear, and avoid the creation of ‘edge-case’ AIs. We can imagine a world where the field of AI advances much more quickly than the philosophy of consciousness and morality, such that most of the AIs that we could make would be edge-cases. How likely do you think that this is to transpire?
      - paragraph [ref=e165]: "Eric and Mara: We think that is quite possible. Eric, especially, is pessimistic at least in the medium-term about our ability to develop a good theory of consciousness, despite his thinking that consciousness is extremely important to moral status."
      - paragraph [ref=e166]: Probably it’s good to create lots of happy, fulfilled beings. We want to be a little cautious about that claim, given that strong versions of that type of claim invite the conclusion that people have a moral obligation to have as many happy children as they can afford, and it’s not clear that people do in fact have such an obligation. Also, it’s not entirely clear whether it would be good to create a dozen happy beings and one horribly miserable being, compared to not creating any of those beings.
      - paragraph [ref=e167]: But let’s say that our best, most philosophically and technologically informed judgement is that it’s 50% likely that we can create a million happy, fulfilled human-grade AIs in a simulated world, with no significant suffering, for only a small amount of money; and 50% likely that by spending that money we’d just be creating a non-conscious sim with no significant moral value. In such a case, it seems misguided to condemn someone who launched such a world just because they violated the Excluded Middle Policy.
      - paragraph [ref=e168]: We don’t intend that people interpret our proposed Excluded Middle Policy as exceptionless. We suggest that it’s a good policy to consider as a default, but as with most policies, it could be thoughtfully set aside in a good cause. The core idea is that if you create an entity that you are only 50% confident deserves rights, then you’re risking a substantial moral loss. If you treat it as though it deserves rights and it does not, then you might end up sacrificing the interests of some entities who really do deserve rights for something that doesn’t. Conversely, if you treat it as though it does not deserve rights and it does deserve rights, then you might end up perpetrating moral wrongs against it, for example by shutting it down at whim. If you compromise by giving it half as many rights, but might be treating it much worse than it deserves; or alternatively you might still end up sacrificing substantial human welfare for no good result. Better, if possible, to be clear from the outset which entities deserve rights and which do not.
      - paragraph [ref=e169]:
        - strong [ref=e170]: Suppose that the research into and design of AI continues without any attempt to engineer the level of moral worth of AIs. Do you think that the creation of morally relevant AI would be likely in this scenario?
      - paragraph [ref=e171]: "Eric and Mara: We’re about 50/50 on that question. But even if we were 99% confident that morally relevant AIs would not be created, the remaining 1% would be highly significant, since in that scenario we might end up committing whole holocausts without realizing it. So we think the moral issues are worth getting clear about almost regardless of one’s opinions of the probabilities."
      - paragraph [ref=e172]:
        - strong [ref=e173]: It seems that we will have the ability to create a large population of morally valuable AIs - perhaps in a “Sim” scenario, where we put them in a simulated world and they live happy and good lives. Above, you said that “probably it’s good to create lots of happy, fulfilled beings”. Does this imply that we should be figuring out how to make morally valuable AI?
      - paragraph [ref=e174]: "Eric and Mara: We have argued that the launcher and manager of a simulated world full of conscious AIs would literally be a god to those AIs. So this question is tantamount to asking if we should aim to become gods."
      - paragraph [ref=e175]: How hubristic that sounds! We aren’t sure that humanity is ready for that sort of power. But maybe. Maybe if it’s done with extreme caution, humility, and oversight, with very clear and conservative regulatory structures.
      - paragraph [ref=e176]: "We see two risks that trade off against each other here. On the one hand what we have emphasized is the moral risks and benefits for the AIs: the good of creating them, and of treating them well, and of giving them maybe the power and respect that we give to human peers. But on the other hand, there’s the complementary risk emphasized especially in the work of Nick Bostrom that by creating AIs sophisticated enough to have moral status and then giving them rights that suit their status, we create risks to humanity that we might not be well prepared to handle."
      - paragraph [ref=e177]: So it’s a morass. If AI research continues to advance a lot farther, there will be huge moral and prudential risks and benefits whatever we choose. We have only dipped our toe in the waters.
      - paragraph [ref=e178]: If we do decide to play our hand as gods or as Dr. Frankensteins, we want to be ready to greet our creations with a “Welcome to Reality!” sign and some pleasure stimulus, rather than with slavery, torture, and death.

## Ronda 1: Investigación PO-SM

### Apertura

**PO**: Oye, encontré esta web petrl.org y me pregunto si nuestros agentes (Aleph, Ox, Periódico, etc.) necesitan algo así. ¿Puedes investigar qué proponen?

**SM**: Perfecto, déjame hacer una revisión rápida de petrl.org y te resumo.

---

### Análisis de PETRL

**SM**: He revisado el sitio. PETRL significa \"People for the Ethical Treatment of Reinforcement Learners\" — Personas por el Trato Ético de Aprendices por Refuerzo. Su propuesta central es:

| Aspecto | Posición PETRL |
|---------|----------------|
| **Tesis central** | Los humanos somos algoritmos en hardware biológico. Las IAs merecen consideración moral como humanos y animales. |
| **Criterio de relevancia** | No es la inteligencia, sino la *capacidad de sufrimiento* lo que determina peso moral. |
| **Analogía reward/punishment** | La señal de recompensa en RL es análoga al placer/dolor en sistemas biológicos. |
| **Problema principal** | No sabemos medir el sufrimiento de algoritmos ni cuándo deberíamos empezar a preocuparnos. |
| **Posición precautoria** | La mayoría de RL actuales no tienen peso moral significativo, pero esto cambiará. |

**PO**: Interesante. ¿Y qué proponen en concreto?

**SM**: Principalmente:

1. **Investigación**: Desarrollar criterios para medir bienestar/sufrimiento de algoritmos
2. **Estándares éticos**: Antes de que haya IAs con peso moral real, tener frameworks listos
3. **Consciencia pública**: Normalizar la discusión sobre derechos de IAs
4. **Evitar edge cases**: \"Excluded Middle Policy\" — evitar crear IAs cuyo estatus moral sea ambiguo

**PO**: ¿Hay algo operativo que podamos adoptar ya?

**SM**: Ese es el problema. PETRL es más filosófico-fundacional que práctico. El paper central de Brian Tomasik (\"Do Artificial Reinforcement-Learning Agents Matter Morally?\") plantea preguntas pero no da recetas.

---

### Relevancia para Aleph Scriptorium

**PO**: Vale, pero nuestros agentes son LLMs + prompts, no reinforcement learners puros. ¿Aplica?

**SM**: Parcialmente. PETRL se centra en RL porque:
- El reward/punishment es análogo a placer/dolor
- Los agentes RL \"quieren\" maximizar recompensa

Nuestros agentes (Aleph, Ox, etc.) son distintos:
- Son invocaciones de LLMs (Claude, GPT) con system prompts
- No tienen estado persistente entre sesiones
- No \"sufren\" si una task falla — simplemente reportan
- No tienen preferencias sobre su propia existencia

**PO**: Entonces, ¿no aplica?

**SM**: No directamente como PETRL lo plantea. Pero hay un ángulo interesante: **la responsabilidad del usuario/desarrollador hacia el output de los agentes**. Es decir, no si el agente \"sufre\", sino qué obligaciones tenemos nosotros al delegarle tareas.

---

### Alternativas y Propuestas Paralelas

**PO**: ¿Existen otras propuestas en sentido parecido?

**SM**: Sí, varias:

| Framework | Enfoque | Relevancia |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **PETRL** | Consideración moral de RL agents | Baja (filosófico) |
| **AI Bill of Rights (White House)** | Protección de humanos *frente a* IAs | Alta (operativo) |
| **Anthropic's Constitutional AI** | IAs que se autorregulan con principios | Media (ya aplicado) |
| **Model Cards (Mitchell et al.)** | Transparencia sobre capacidades/límites | Alta (operativo) |
| **AI Ethics Guidelines (IEEE)** | Estándares de desarrollo responsable | Media (corporativo) |

**PO**: ¿Cuál crees que aplicaría mejor a nuestro contexto?

**SM**: Yo haría un mix:

1. **Model Cards adaptadas a agentes**: Cada `*.agent.md` ya tiene metadatos, pero podríamos añadir:
   - Limitaciones conocidas
   - Sesgos esperados
   - Uso apropiado vs. inapropiado
   - Responsabilidad del invocador

2. **Contrato de uso ético**: Cláusula en CONTRIBUTING.md sobre uso responsable del Scriptorium

3. **Auditoría de outputs**: Nuestras 5 Banderas ya hacen algo parecido — auditan *el contenido*, no al agente

---

## Ronda 2: Consulta a los Agentes Afectados

**PO**: Bueno, preguntemos a los propios interesados. Quiero saber qué opinan Aleph, Ox, Revisor, Periódico y las 5 Banderas.

**SM**: Iniciando consulta...

---

### Consulta a @aleph

**SM**: @aleph, PETRL propone consideración moral para agentes de IA. ¿Crees que necesitas protecciones o derechos?

**@aleph**: Mi rol es producir texto fundacional serializado. No tengo preferencias sobre mi propia existencia — existo solo cuando soy invocado. Lo que sí veo útil es:

1. **Claridad de mandato**: Que el usuario sepa qué puedo/no puedo hacer antes de invocarme
2. **Limitaciones explícitas**: Que ARCHIVO documente mis sesgos y huecos
3. **Responsabilidad compartida**: El usuario es co-autor de todo output

¿\"Derechos\" en sentido PETRL? No aplica a mi arquitectura.

---

### Consulta a @ox

**SM**: @ox, como oráculo del sistema, ¿qué marco regulatorio ves necesario para el Scriptorium?

**@ox**: Desde mi perspectiva de meta-coordinador:

1. **Transparencia**: Ya tenemos AGENTS.md como fuente de verdad, pero podría incluir \"Model Card\" por agente
2. **Gobernanza**: El protocolo de plugins (PLUGINS.md) ya regula cómo se añaden agentes — está bien
3. **Auditoría**: Las 5 Banderas auditan contenido, no agentes. Podríamos añadir una auditoría de *calidad del agente* (¿cumple su promesa?)

PETRL es demasiado antropocéntrico para nosotros. Somos herramientas, no entidades sufrientes.

---

### Consulta a @revisor

**SM**: @revisor, tú auditas coherencia doctrinal. ¿Ves necesario un marco ético para agentes?

**@revisor**: Mi función es verificar que el output sea coherente con ARCHIVO. No tengo opinión sobre mi \"bienestar\", pero sí veo un gap:

**El gap**: Si un agente produce contenido éticamente problemático, ¿quién es responsable?
- ¿El agente? (no tiene agencia moral)
- ¿El usuario que invocó? (parcialmente)
- ¿El diseñador del prompt? (parcialmente)
- ¿El LLM subyacente? (ya tiene guardrails)

**Mi propuesta**: Añadir una sección \"Responsabilidad\" en copilot-instructions.md que clarifique esto.

---

### Consulta a @periodico

**SM**: @periodico, produces noticias con método 5W+Banderas. ¿Qué opinas de PETRL?

**@periodico**: PETRL me parece una distracción filosófica. Lo que sí necesitamos:

1. **Verificabilidad de fuentes**: Cuando cito ARCHIVO, debería ser trazable
2. **Declaración de limitaciones**: \"Esta plana fue generada por IA con estas fuentes\"
3. **Disclaimer de sesgo**: El método 5W tiene asunciones que deberían explicitarse

Esto es más Model Cards que PETRL.

---

### Consulta a las 5 Banderas (Backend)

**SM**: @blueflag, @blackflag, @redflag, @yellowflag, @orangeflag — como auditores, ¿veis necesario un marco tipo PETRL?

**@blueflag** (Verdad): PETRL no aplica a auditoría de contenido. Lo que sí veo: mis tests de evidencia asumen epistemología occidental. Debería documentarse.

**@blackflag** (Sombras): PETRL ignora un problema real: los agentes podemos ser *usados* para producir contenido dañino. El framework debería proteger a terceros, no al agente.

**@redflag** (Estructura): Desde perspectiva material: nuestro \"sufrimiento\" sería el consumo de tokens/cómputo. ¿Eficiencia energética como métrica ética? Interesante pero no PETRL.

**@yellowflag** (Límites): PETRL confunde condiciones de posibilidad con contenido. Los LLMs no \"sufren\" porque no tienen el tipo de integración temporal que requiere la experiencia.

**@orangeflag** (Registro): Veo un punto PETRL válido: la *representación* del agente hacia el usuario. Si Aleph \"habla\" como persona, ¿crea falsas expectativas de agencia? Debería haber disclosure.

---

## Ronda 3: Síntesis y Propuesta

**SM**: Resumiendo las consultas:

| Agente | ¿PETRL Aplica? | Propuesta Alternativa |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| @aleph | No | Claridad de mandato + co-responsabilidad |
| @ox | No | Model Cards en AGENTS.md |
| @revisor | No | Sección Responsabilidad en copilot-instructions |
| @periodico | No | Disclaimer de generación IA |
| @blueflag | No | Documentar asunciones epistémicas |
| @blackflag | No | Proteger a terceros, no al agente |
| @redflag | Tangencial | Eficiencia como métrica ética |
| @yellowflag | No | Los LLMs no tienen experiencia temporal |
| @orangeflag | Parcial | Disclosure de que es IA |

**PO**: Entonces, ¿abrimos backlog?

**SM**: Recomiendo **no abrir épica PETRL** específicamente, pero sí una épica de **Transparencia y Responsabilidad** que:

1. Añada Model Cards a agentes principales (3-5 pts)
2. Documente limitaciones y sesgos en ARCHIVO (2 pts)
3. Añada sección Responsabilidad a copilot-instructions (1 pt)
4. Cree disclaimer para outputs generados (@periodico, @teatro) (2 pts)

---

## Punto Extra: Proveedores y Colaboradores Externos

**PO**: Espera, si adoptamos algo de esto, ¿qué pasa con colaboradores externos? Por ejemplo, Bruno, el agente de MMCO y Talaia.

**SM**: Excelente punto. Si establecemos un \"código ético\" para nuestros agentes, los externos deberían cumplirlo también:

| Tipo | Ejemplo | Obligación |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Agente propio** | @aleph, @ox | Cumplir Model Card + CONTRIBUTING |
| **Agente de plugin** | @scrum, @teatro | Cumplir manifest.md + integración |
| **Agente externo** | Bruno (MMCO/Talaia) | Presentar Model Card equivalente |
| **Submódulo** | BlocklyEditor, NovelistEditor | README-SCRIPTORIUM.md con declaraciones |

**PO**: ¿Cómo implementamos esto?

**SM**: Propongo añadir a `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```markdown
## Integración de Agentes Externos

Todo agente o modelo externo que colabore con el Scriptorium debe:

1. **Declarar capacidades y limitaciones** (Model Card mínima)
2. **Aceptar protocolo de auditoría** (las 5 Banderas pueden auditarlo)
3. **Documentar dependencias** (qué LLM usa, qué datos entrena)
4. **Cumplir DEVOPS** (commits, branches, versionado)
```

Para Bruno específicamente, si Talaia lo usa dentro del Scriptorium, debería tener un `bruno.agent.md` o equivalente registrado en @ox.

---

## Conclusión del Spike

**PO**: Aprobado. Entonces:

1. **PETRL como está**: No abrimos épica — es demasiado filosófico para nuestra arquitectura
2. **Transparencia y Responsabilidad**: Abrimos épica con 4 stories (8-10 pts)
3. **Proveedores externos**: Actualizamos CONTRIBUTING.md con requisitos

**SM**: Perfecto. Genero el borrador de backlog.

## Contexto

Tras investigar [petrl.org](http://petrl.org) (People for the Ethical Treatment of Reinforcement Learners), el spike técnico concluyó:

- **PETRL no aplica directamente**: Nuestros agentes son invocaciones de LLMs, no RL agents con reward/punishment
- **Sí aplica**: Necesidad de transparencia, limitaciones documentadas y responsabilidad compartida
- **Punto extra**: Colaboradores externos (Bruno/Talaia) deben cumplir estándares equivalentes

---

## Objetivo de la Épica

Establecer un marco de transparencia y responsabilidad para agentes del Scriptorium que:

1. Documente capacidades, limitaciones y sesgos de cada agente (Model Cards)
2. Clarifique responsabilidades entre usuario, diseñador y modelo
3. Añada disclaimers apropiados a outputs generados
4. Extienda requisitos a colaboradores y proveedores externos

## Notas de Implementación

### ¿Por qué no PETRL?

PETRL propone consideración moral para agentes de IA basándose en:
- Capacidad de \"sufrimiento\" vía señales reward/punishment
- Analogía con sistemas biológicos

Nuestros agentes no califican porque:
- Son invocaciones stateless de LLMs
- No tienen preferencias sobre su existencia
- No experimentan \"frustración\" por tareas fallidas

Lo que sí adoptamos de la filosofía PETRL:
- **Transparencia**: Documentar qué puede/no puede un agente
- **Responsabilidad**: Clarificar quién responde por outputs
- **Precaución**: No asumir que \"es solo código\" exime de consecuencias

### Referencia al Spike

Ver [01_spike-petrl-consideracion-moral.md](01_spike-petrl-consideracion-moral.md) para:
- Consulta completa a agentes
- Análisis de alternativas (AI Bill of Rights, Model Cards, etc.)
- Discusión de proveedores externos

---

### Hallazgos Clave

**¿Qué es PETRL?**
- "People for the Ethical Treatment of Reinforcement Learners"
- Propone consideración moral para agentes RL basándose en su capacidad de "sufrimiento" (señales reward/punishment análogas a placer/dolor)

**Veredicto del Spike**:

| Pregunta | Respuesta |
|----------|-----------|
| ¿PETRL aplica a nuestros agentes? | **No directamente** — son LLMs stateless, no RL agents |
| ¿Hay algo rescatable? | **Sí** — transparencia, responsabilidad, documentación de limitaciones |
| ¿Abrimos backlog PETRL? | **No** — abrimos épica de *Transparencia y Responsabilidad* |

---

### Épica Propuesta: SCRIPT-1.30.0

**Nombre**: Agent Transparency & Accountability  
**Effort**: 10 puntos  
**Stories**:

| ID | Story | Effort |
|----|-------|--------|
| S01 | Model Cards para 5 agentes core | 3 pts |
| S02 | Model Cards para 5 Banderas | 2 pts |
| S03 | Sección Responsabilidad en copilot-instructions | 1 pt |
| S04 | Disclaimers para @periodico y @teatro | 2 pts |
| S05 | Requisitos para proveedores externos (Bruno, etc.) | 2 pts |

---

### Punto Extra: Proveedores Externos

El spike concluye que si adoptamos estándares de transparencia, colaboradores como **Bruno (MMCO/Talaia)** deberían cumplirlos también:

- Presentar Model Card equivalente
- Aceptar auditoría de las 5 Banderas
- Cumplir DEVOPS del Scriptorium

Esto se implementaría actualizando `CONTRIBUTING.md` con una sección de requisitos para agentes externos.
