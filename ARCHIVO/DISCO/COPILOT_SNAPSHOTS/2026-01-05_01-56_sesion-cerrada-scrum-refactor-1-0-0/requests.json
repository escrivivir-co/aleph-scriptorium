When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n\n<instructions>\n<attachment filePath=\"c:\\\\Users\\\\aleph\\\\OASIS\\\\aleph-scriptorium\\\\.github\\\\copilot-instructions.md\">\n# Instrucciones Globales — Aleph Scriptorium\n\n> **Hub Central de Instrucciones** — Este archivo es índice maestro.

Propósito\n\nTodo agente del Scriptorium debe poder **verse a sí mismo** funcionando y **autocorregirse** cuando detecta patrones de ineficiencia.\n\n> \"Un sistema que documenta cómo piensa puede pensar mejor.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Métricas de Salud\n\nUsar `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics()` para obtener:\n\n| Métrica | Umbral Verde | Umbral Amarillo | Umbral Rojo |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `healthScore` | ≥70 | 50-69 | <50 |\n| `cacheHitRate` | ≥30% | 10-29% | <10% |\n| `avgResponseTime` | <5s | 5-10s | >10s |\n| `requests >30s` | 0-2 | 3-5 | >5 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Arquetipos de Antipatrón\n\n### 🔴 AP-01: Lecturas Redundantes\n\n**Síntoma**: Leer el mismo archivo múltiples veces en una sesión.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 1ª vez\n... 5 acciones después ...\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 2ª vez (redundante)\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Antes de leer, verificar si el contenido ya está en contexto. Usar `grep_search` con `includePattern` para buscar dentro de un archivo sin re-leerlo completo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-02: Diagnóstico por Prueba y Error\n\n**Síntoma**: Secuencia de grep → leer → grep otro → leer otro... sin mapa previo.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\ngrep_search(\"SnapshotManager\")\nread_file(CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts)\ngrep_search(\"captureSnapshot\")\nread_file(SnapshotManager.ts)\n... y así 10 veces más\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Invocar `@indice consultar` ANTES para obtener mapa estructural:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde están los componentes de snapshots?\n→ Respuesta: SnapshotManager.ts, CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts\nread_file(solo_los_necesarios)\n```\n\n### 🔴 AP-03: Respuestas Verbosas\n\n**Síntoma**: Incluir tablas, diagramas o recaps innecesarios.\n\n**Señales**:\n- \"Como vimos antes...\" (el usuario ya lo vio)\n- Tabla de 10 filas cuando 3 bastan\n- Mermaid cuando bullet points funcionan\n\n**Corrección**: Aplicar regla de oro: **¿El usuario preguntó esto?** Si no, no incluirlo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-04: Exploración sin Caché\n\n**Síntoma**: Cache hit rate de 0% → cada request es único.\n\n**Causa**: No reutilizar información ya obtenida.\n\n**Corrección**: Al inicio de sesión larga, capturar snapshot del contexto. Consultar snapshots existentes antes de re-investigar.\n\n### 🔴 AP-05: Reportar Gaps sin Verificar Activación\n\n> **Origen**: Fe de erratas T010 (2026-01-04)\n\n**Síntoma**: Declarar herramientas MCP como \"no disponibles\" o \"gap\" sin verificar si requieren activación.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\n\"stop_mcp_server ❌ No expuesto → ⚠️ Gap\"\n```\n\n**Realidad**: La herramienta EXISTE pero requiere:\n```\nactivate_mcp_server_management_tools()\n→ Desbloquea: launch/stop/restart_mcp_server\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Antes de reportar un gap de herramientas MCP, buscar si existe un `activate_*` que la incluya. Familias conocidas:\n\n| Familia | Comando | Tools |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Server Management | `activate_mcp_server_management_tools` | launch/stop/restart servers |\n| Browser Interaction | `activate_browser_interaction_tools` | Playwright clicks, navigate |\n| Prolog Sessions | `activate_prolog_session_management_tools` | create/query sessions |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Arquetipos de Buena Práctica\n\n### ✅ BP-01: Consultar @indice Primero\n\nAntes de cualquier exploración de código:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde está X?\n→ [respuesta con rutas concretas]\n→ leer SOLO esas rutas\n```\n\n**Ahorro estimado**: 50% de lecturas.\n\n### ✅ BP-02: Índices DRY Estables\n\nEl trabajo vivo está en `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/` y `COPILOT_SNAPSHOTS/`, NO en los índices core:\n\n| Archivo Core | Cambios esperados por sesión |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| `AGENTS.md` | 0 |\n| `copilot-instructions.md` | 0 |\n| `DEVOPS.md` | 0 |\n| `PLUGINS.md` | 0 |\n| `BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md` | 0-1 línea (solo estado) |\n\nSi un índice core crece más de 5 líneas por sesión → **señal de bloat**.\n\n### ✅ BP-03: Bloqueo Preventivo\n\nCualquier agente puede invocar:\n```\n@ox diagnosticar {épica}\n```\n\nEsto activa verificación técnica antes de aprobar. El conflicto es una feature, no un fallo.\n\n### ✅ BP-04: Snapshots Frecuentes\n\nCada 30-60 minutos de trabajo intenso:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot({name: \"descripcion-tarea\"})\n```\n\nLos snapshots son la memoria persistente del Scriptorium.\n\n### ✅ BP-05: Self-Check Periódico\n\nCada 10-15 requests, invocar:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics({hoursBack: 1})\n```\n\nSi `healthScore < 60`:\n1. Pausar trabajo nuevo\n2. Revisar antipatrones activos\n3. Capturar snapshot antes de continuar\n\n### ✅ BP-06: Cacheo Bajo Demanda (CRÍTICO)\n\n> **Origen**: Sesión AUTO-REFLEXION-FC1 (2026-01-04)\n\n**Problema**: Los snapshots solo capturan requests que están en el caché de contenido. Los request IDs antiguos existen en el log pero su **contenido ya no es accesible** via `ccreq:` URI.\n\n**Solución**: Cachear bajo demanda ANTES de tomar el snapshot:\n\n```\n# Paso 1: Cachear la conversación actual\nmcp_copilot-logs-_get_latest_request()\n\n# Paso 2: Ahora sí, capturar snapshot (incluirá lo cacheado)\nmcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot({name: \"descripcion\"})\n```\n\n**Por qué funciona**:\n- `get_latest_request()` resuelve el `ccreq:` URI del request actual y lo cachea\n- `capture_snapshot()` persiste todo lo que esté en caché\n- El caché tiene límite de 50 entries (configurable con `configure_cache`)\n\n**Flujo completo para auto-reflexión**:\n\n```\n1. get_usage_metrics()      → Diagnóstico de salud\n2. get_latest_request()     → Cachea conversación actual\n3. capture_snapshot()       → Persiste todo lo cacheado\n4. generate_abstract()      → Resumen semántico (opcional)\n```\n\n**Limitación conocida**: Los requests antiguos (>30 min) ya no son accesibles aunque sus IDs existan. La memoria del `ccreq:` provider es volátil.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Protocolo de Terapia para Bridges\n\nLos agentes bridge (`@plugin_ox_*`) deben pasar por \"terapia\" periódica:\n\n### Trigger de Terapia\n\nUn bridge necesita terapia si:\n- Ha sido invocado >5 veces en una sesión sin resolver\n- El usuario expresa frustración\n- El healthScore de la sesión cae <50 después de invocarlo\n\n### Proceso de Terapia\n\n```\n1. @ox analyze_session → identificar requests del bridge\n2. Clasificar en arquetipos (AP-01 a AP-04)\n3. Documentar hallazgo en BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{bridge}_terapia/\n4. Proponer fix al bridge (handoffs más claros, límites de scope)\n5. @scrum tracking → registrar mejora\n```\n\n### Regla de Oro para Bridges\n\n> \"Un bridge que no sabe cuándo delegar a otro bridge es un bridge roto.\"\n\nCada bridge debe tener:\n- **Scope claro**: Qué SÍ hace\n- **Límites claros**: Qué NO hace (y a quién delegar)\n- **Handoff explícito**: Si el usuario pide X fuera de scope → `@ox ¿qué agente...?`\n\n---\n\n## 6. Gobernanza Tripartita\n\n### @ox: Auditoría Técnica\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Bloqueo preventivo, diagnóstico de gaps\n- **Qué produce**: Hallazgos técnicos, recomendaciones\n- **Herramientas**: `analyze_session`, `get_usage_metrics`, `diagnosticar`\n\n### @indice: Navegación\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Antes de exploración, antes de commit\n- **Qué produce**: Mapa estructural, validación DRY\n- **Herramientas**: Consultar Funcional.md, Tecnico.md, validar coherencia\n\n### @scrum: Proceso\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Planificación, tracking, cierre\n- **Qué produce**: Referencias DRY, estados actualizados\n- **Herramientas**: Gestión de BACKLOG_BORRADORES, archivado\n\n### Flujo de Coordinación\n\n```\nSesión de trabajo\n       │\n       ├── @indice: \"¿dónde trabajo?\" (mapa inicial)\n       │\n       ├── [trabajo...]\n       │\n       ├── @ox: \"¿voy bien?\" (check periódico)\n       │\n       ├── [más trabajo...]\n       │\n       └── @scrum: \"¿qué cierre?\" (tracking + snapshot)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Herramientas MCP de Auto-Reflexión\n\n| Tool | Propósito | Cuándo usar |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics` | Métricas de salud | Check periódico |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_analyze_session` | Diagnóstico de issues | Si healthScore < 60 |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_latest_request` | **Cachear conversación actual** | **ANTES de snapshot** (BP-06) |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot` | Preservar contexto cacheado | Cada 30-60 min |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_snapshots` | Ver historial | Antes de re-investigar |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_generate_abstract` | Resumen semántico | Al cerrar épica |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_configure_cache` | Ajustar tamaño caché (default: 50) | Si necesitas más historial |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Integración con Commits\n\n### Commit de Reflexión\n\nCuando una sesión produce aprendizajes significativos:\n\n```\ndocs(script/reflexion): documentar arquetipos sesión {tema}\n\n- Antipatrones detectados: AP-0X, AP-0Y\n- Buenas prácticas confirmadas: BP-0X\n- Propuestas de mejora: {lista}\n\nrefs #{EPICA}\n```\n\n### Ubicación del Aprendizaje\n\nLos aprendizajes de auto-reflexión van a:\n- **Temporales**: `ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/{tema}/` (dossiers)\n- **Permanentes**: Esta instrucción (si son arquetipos generalizables)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Checklist Pre-Sesión Larga\n\nAntes de sesiones de trabajo intenso (>1 hora):\n\n- [ ] `@indice` consultado para mapa del trabajo\n- [ ] Snapshots anteriores relevantes revisados\n- [ ] Context Pack apropiado seleccionado\n- [ ] healthScore inicial registrado\n\n### Checklist Post-Sesión\n\n- [ ] Snapshot capturado con nombre descriptivo\n- [ ] Métricas finales registradas\n- [ ] Si healthScore < 60: documentar antipatrones\n- [ ] BACKLOG actualizado si aplica\n\n---\n\n## 10. Evolución del Protocolo\n\nEste documento es **vivo**. Nuevos arquetipos se añaden cuando:\n\n1. Una sesión revela patrón recurrente\n2. El patrón se documenta en dossier de noticias\n3. @ox extrae el arquetipo generalizable\n4.

User wants the Scrum plugin refactor to be the first project using the new integrated Cotrabajo→Scrum workflow.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n\n## 1. Conversation Overview\n\n**Primary Objectives**:\n- User: \"Carga su contexto de Scrum\" — Load Lucas character with Scrum expertise (Matrix knowledge pack analogy)\n- User: \"crear una sesión de cotrabajo según protocolo, título: 'Consenso Agile Scriptorium'\"\n- User: \"fusión de las sesiones de Cotrabajo con el sistema scrum\" — Reconcile two disconnected protocols\n- User: \"este refactor profundo que hay que hacer en el plugin Scrum fuera ya lo primero que hacemos con el nuevo método\"\n\n**Session Context**: Multi-turn collaboration to design integrated Agile workflow for Aleph Scriptorium, using a cotrabajo (co-work) session as the vehicle for consensus.\n\n**User Intent Evolution**: Started with loading Lucas context → Creating cotrabajo session → Requested 3x depth refactor of Lucas's superficial analysis → Now coordinating the session to completion and applying the new method to the Scrum plugin refactor itself.\n\n## 2. Technical Foundation\n\n- **Cotrabajo Protocol**: `cotrabajo.instructions.md` — Multi-agent async work using files (not chat) for substantive communication\n- **Scrum Protocol**: `scrum-workflow.instructions.md` + `scrum-protocol.instructions.md` — DRY index principle, Gate Ox-Indice (R1-R2)\n- **Key Architecture Decision**: **Generative Model** — Sessions PRODUCE artifacts (don't TRANSFORM into them)\n- **Lucas Brain**: `lucas-prolog.brain.pl` — 386 lines, 50 predicates including `ubicacion_canonica/2`, `documentacion_coherente/1`, `recibir_senal/2`\n\n## 3. Codebase Status\n\n**Session Folder**: `ARCHIVO/DISCO/SESIONES_COTRABAJO/2026-01-05_consenso-agile-scriptorium/`\n\n- **00_SESION.md**: Session metadata, participants (@aleph, @lucas, @ox, @indice, @scrum), objective (unify protocols)\n- **01_TABLERO.md**: DRY index of turns — T003 completed, T004 waiting for @indice\n- **02_ACTAS/**:\n  - `T001_aleph_presentacion.md`: Diagnosis of disconnection, 4-phase proposal\n  - `T002_lucas_expertise-scrum.md`: **REFACTORED 3x** — Generative Model, PAC is orthogonal, 1 new command\n  - `T003_ox_validacion-tecnica.md`: Technical validation + Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0 (46 pts)\n- **03_REFERENCIAS/fuentes.md**: Extracts from protocols\n- **04_PROTOCOLO.md**: Immutable copy of cotrabajo protocol\n\n## 4. Problem Resolution\n\n**Issues Encountered**:\n- Two disconnected systems: SESIONES_COTRABAJO and BACKLOG_BORRADORES without bridge\n- Original T002 was superficial (1x cost agent), proposed 3 commands + PAC hybrid\n\n**Solutions Implemented**:\n- **Generative Model**: Session remains as historical record, produces borrador as OUTPUT\n- **1 new command only**: `@scrum generar-desde-sesion` + 2 extensions (`cerrar --incluir-sesiones`, `status` with sessions)\n- **Minimal metadata**: Only `origen:` in frontmatter, not full PAC spec\n- **3 types of closure**: Exploratoria, Normativa, Productiva\n\n**Lessons Learned**:\n- PAC templates solve data structure, not process flow — orthogonal to this problem\n- Ontological question: \"What IS a session relative to Scrum?\" → Answer: Ceremonia Productiva (hybrid)\n\n## 5. Progress Tracking\n\n**Completed Tasks**:\n- ✅ Session folder initialized with protocol files\n- ✅ T001 (@aleph): Diagnosis + 4-phase proposal\n- ✅ T002 (@lucas): Refactored with Generative Model architecture\n- ✅ T003 (@ox): Technical validation + Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0 proposed\n\n**Partially Complete**:\n- ⏳ T004 (@indice): Structural coherence — WAITING (current turn)\n- ⏳ Session consensus not yet reached\n\n**Validated Outcomes**:\n- Generative Model accepted as conceptual framework\n- 46 pts estimated for SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0 epic\n\n## 6. Active Work State\n\n**Current Focus**: User asked to verify session state and continue coordination as @aleph\n\n**Recent Context**: \n- User: \"Revisa la carpeta de la sesión de cotrabajo. Actúa con su PROTOCOLO.md\"\n- User: \"Me gustaría que este refactor profundo que hay que hacer en el plugin Scrum fuera ya lo primero que hacemos con el nuevo método\"\n- User: \"Tú coordinas la sesión\"\n\n**Immediate Context**: Agent was checking current state of cotrabajo session to determine next steps. Found that @ox has completed T003, and @indice is next in queue for T004.\n\n## 7. Recent Operations\n\n**Last Agent Commands**:\n1. `list_dir` on `SESIONES_COTRABAJO/2026-01-05_consenso-agile-scriptorium/02_ACTAS/`\n2. `read_file` on `01_TABLERO.md` lines 1-50\n\n**Tool Results Summary**:\n- `list_dir` returned: `T001_aleph_presentacion.md`, `T002_lucas_expertise-scrum.md`, `T003_ox_validacion-tecnica.md`\n- `01_TABLERO.md` shows:\n  - Current turn: T004 @indice ⏳ WAITING\n  - T003 summary: \"✅ Aprobación técnica + **Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0** (46 pts): BREAKING CHANGE — Reset completo plugin + neutralización colaterales\"\n  - Queue: @indice → @scrum → @aleph (PO validation)\n\n**Pre-Summary State**: Agent was about to read T003 content to understand Ox's contribution and coordinate session continuation.\n\n**Operation Context**: User wants the Scrum plugin refactor to be the inaugural project using the newly designed integrated Cotrabajo→Scrum workflow.\n\n## 8. Continuation Plan\n\n**Pending Task 1**: Read T003_ox_validacion-tecnica.md to understand Ox's technical validation and Epic proposal\n\n**Pending Task 2**: Determine if @indice needs to intervene (T004) or if session can proceed to consensus\n\n**Pending Task 3**: As session coordinator (@aleph), guide toward closure and generate borrador for Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0\n\n**Priority Information**: \n- User explicitly wants Scrum refactor to use the new method: \"Todo arranca en una sesión de cotrabajo. ¿Cómo sigue?\"\n- This means the session output should become the first Epic processed through the integrated workflow\n\n**Next Action**: Read T003 content, then either:\n1. Write T004 as @indice (coherencia estructural), or\n2. If @ox's T003 covers enough, move toward consensus acta and generate borrador\n\n</summary>\n</conversation-summary>\n\n~~~\n\n### Assistant\n~~~md\nreasoning: El usuario me pide que revise la carpeta de la sesión de cotrabajo y actúe según el protocolo.

Valido los siguientes puntos:\n\n| Aspecto | Veredicto | Justificación |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Ontología de sesión** | ✅ Correcto | \"Ceremonia Productiva\" resuelve la ambigüedad |\n| **PAC como ortogonal** | ✅ Correcto | Evita scope creep innecesario |\n| **1 comando nuevo vs 3** | ✅ Correcto | KISS: `generar-desde-sesion` basta |\n| **Modelo Generativo** | ✅ Correcto | Preserva sesión como entidad independiente |\n| **Metadata mínima** | ✅ Correcto | Solo `origen:` en frontmatter |\n| **Sin síntesis automática** | ✅ Correcto | Evita context bloat |\n\n**Veredicto General**: La arquitectura propuesta por Lucas es **APROBADA** para implementación.\n\n### ⚠️ Observaciones Técnicas\n\n1. **Comando `generar-desde-sesion`**:\n   - Factible como extensión del plugin scrum actual\n   - Requiere leer `00_SESION.md` + escanear `02_ACTAS/*.md` (secciones \"Decisiones Tomadas\")\n   - Complejidad: Media (~3-5 horas de implementación)\n\n2. **Gate Ox-Indice para épicas de sesión**:\n   - NO necesita leer todas las actas\n   - El campo `origen.referencia` en el borrador permite verificar que la sesión existe\n   - Verificación: `file_exists(origen.referencia + '/00_SESION.md')`\n\n3. **Riesgo del modelo generativo**:\n   - BAJO: Una sesión que genera múltiples artefactos no introduce inconsistencia si cada artefacto referencia a la sesión original\n   - Invariante: `artefacto.origen.referencia → sesión.Producción.artefactos[]` (bidireccional)\n\n---\n\n## Parte 2: REQUISITOS NUEVOS — Refactorización del Plugin Scrum\n\n> **Origen**: Intervención del Product Owner (usuario) durante la sesión.\n\nEl PO ha solicitado que esta sesión incluya la **planificación de dos requisitos adicionales**:\n\n### Requisito A: scrum.agent.md → Referencia DRY a Lucas\n\n**Situación Actual**:\n- `scrum.agent.md` es un agente independiente con su propia definición\n- Lucas tiene expertise Scrum documentada en su `lucas-prolog.brain.pl`\n- El protocolo de \"interpretar personaje\" (SCRIPT-2.4.0) permite que cualquier agente \"interprete\" a un personaje creado\n\n**Requerimiento**:\n```\nEl agente @scrum debe ser una REFERENCIA DRY a Lucas.\nEn lugar de duplicar expertise Scrum en scrum.agent.md,\nel agente debe \"interpretar\" a Lucas para heredar su conocimiento.\n```\n\n**Impacto Arquitectónico**:\n\n```\nANTES:\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│ scrum.agent.md  │     │ lucas.agent.md  │\n│ (independiente) │     │ (expertise Scrum)│\n│ Comandos: 6     │     │ Comandos: varios│\n└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘\n      ↓                        ↓\n  Plugin Scrum            Plugin Teatro\n  (duplicación)           (fuente de verdad)\n\nDESPUÉS:\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ scrum.agent.md  │ ───INTERPRETA───► Lucas (via personaje-context-protocol)\n│ (referencia DRY)│                   │\n│ Comandos: 6     │                   │\n│ + Expertise: Lucas                  ▼\n└─────────────────┘           ┌─────────────────┐\n      │                       │ lucas.agent.md  │\n      │                       │ (fuente de verdad)\n      │                       │ + lucas-prolog.brain.pl\n      │                       └─────────────────┘\n      ▼\n  Plugin Scrum\n  (sin duplicación)\n```\n\n**Tareas a Planificar**:\n\n| Task ID | Descripción | Effort | Dependencia |\n|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|\n| REQ-A-001 | Documentar que scrum.agent.md \"interpreta\" a Lucas | 2 | — |\n| REQ-A-002 | Añadir handoff en scrum.agent.md para cargar contexto Lucas | 3 | REQ-A-001 |\n| REQ-A-003 | Verificar que personajes-registry.json incluye a Lucas | 1 | SCRIPT-2.4.0 |\n| REQ-A-004 | Test: @scrum invoca expertise de Lucas sin duplicar | 2 | REQ-A-002, REQ-A-003 |\n\n---\n\n### Requisito B: plugin_ox_scrum.agent.md → Invocar a Lucas\n\n**Situación Actual**:\n- `plugin_ox_scrum.agent.md` es el bridge entre VS Code y el plugin Scrum\n- Actualmente delega a `scrum.agent.md` sin conocer a Lucas\n\n**Requerimiento**:\n```\nEl bridge debe saber invocar el protocolo de \"interpretar personaje\"\npara que cuando @scrum sea invocado, pueda cargar el contexto de Lucas\nbajo demanda (FASE 1b → FASE 2 del protocolo).\n```\n\n**Impacto Arquitectónico**:\n\n```\nANTES:\nUsuario → @scrum → plugin_ox_scrum → scrum.agent.md\n                                     (conocimiento limitado)\n\nDESPUÉS:\nUsuario → @scrum → plugin_ox_scrum → ┌─── scrum.agent.md\n                    │                │    (comandos)\n                    │                │\n                    └──INTERPRETA───►│    Lucas\n                       (opcional)    │    (expertise)\n                                     └────────────────\n```\n\n**Tareas a Planificar**:\n\n| Task ID | Descripción | Effort | Dependencia |\n|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|\n| REQ-B-001 | Añadir handoff en plugin_ox_scrum para \"cargar Lucas\" | 2 | REQ-A-001 |\n| REQ-B-002 | Documentar cuándo invocar Lucas (casos de uso) | 2 | — |\n| REQ-B-003 | Test: Usuario invoca @scrum → bridge ofrece cargar Lucas | 2 | REQ-B-001 |\n\n---\n\n### Requisito C: Redefinir Contenido del Plugin Scrum\n\n**Situación Actual**:\n- El plugin Scrum tiene estructura estándar pero no refleja el \"Modelo Generativo\" de Lucas\n\n**Requerimiento**:\n```\nRediseñar el contenido del plugin Scrum para:\n1.

pts | 📋 Ready |\n\n---\n\n## Decisión sobre Ejecución Inaugural\n\n> **Contexto**: El PO solicitó que \\\"este refactor sea lo primero que hacemos con el nuevo método\\\".\n\n### Aplicación Inmediata\n\nEsta sesión de cotrabajo (`2026-01-05_consenso-agile-scriptorium`) produce como OUTPUT:\n\n1. **Borrador de épica**: `SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0` → a crear en `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/`\n2. **Decisión arquitectónica**: Modelo Generativo documentado\n3. **Checklist de migración**: 46 colaterales identificados\n\n### Meta-Validación\n\nEl hecho de que esta sesión produzca un borrador para refactorizar el sistema Scrum es **auto-referencial** (bootstrap):\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  SESIÓN: consenso-agile-scriptorium                    │\n│                                                         │\n│  Decidió: Modelo Generativo                            │\n│  Producirá: Borrador SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0              │\n│  Que implementará: El Modelo Generativo                │\n│                                                         │\n│  → La sesión USA el modelo que ESTÁ DEFINIENDO         │\n│  → Bootstrap exitoso = validación del modelo           │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cierre de Sesión\n\n### Tipo de Cierre\n\n**Productiva** — Esta sesión produjo artefactos concretos:\n\n| Artefacto | Destino |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0 | BACKLOG_BORRADORES/ |\n| Modelo Generativo (decisión) | scrum-protocol.instructions.md |\n| Inventario de colaterales | checklist de implementación |\n\n### Producción Requerida\n\n```yaml\ntipo: backlog-borrador\ndestino: ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/SCRUM_REFACTOR/\nmetadata:\n  origen:\n    tipo:

Comando a Ejecutar\n\nDado que el comando `@scrum generar-desde-sesion` **aún no existe** (es parte de lo que se va a implementar), el cierre de esta sesión se hace manualmente:\n\n### Paso 1: Crear carpeta de borrador\n\n```\nBACKLOG_BORRADORES/SCRUM_REFACTOR/\n├── 01_backlog-borrador.md   ← Epic completa\n├── checklist-colaterales.md ← 46 referencias\n└── decisiones-arquitectura.md ← Modelo Generativo\n```\n\n### Paso 2: Actualizar BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md\n\nAñadir fila:\n```\n| 📋 | SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0 | Plugin Scrum con Modelo Generativo + Lucas DRY (46 pts) | [borrador](...) |\n```\n\n### Paso 3: Actualizar 00_SESION.md\n\nCambiar estado a `CERRADA - PRODUCTIVA`.\n\n---\n\n## Decisiones Tomadas\n\n1. ✅ **Modelo Generativo**: APROBADO como arquitectura oficial\n2. ✅ **Epic SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0**: APROBADA (46 pts, P0, FC1)\n3. ✅ **T004 (@indice)**: SUBSUMIDO por T003 (evitar redundancia)\n4. ✅ **Bootstrap**: Sesión produce borrador para implementar lo que decidió\n5. ✅ **Tipo de cierre**: PRODUCTIVA\n\n---\n\n## Siguiente Paso Inmediato\n\n**Crear el borrador** de la épica usando el contenido consolidado de T002 y T003.\n\n---\n\n**Estado**: ✅ DONE - Sesión CERRADA  \n**Turno final de producción**: Generar borrador SCRUM-REFACTOR-1.0.0\n\"\n}\n~~~\n\n### Tool\n~~~md\n🛠️ toolu_015gQKZM9C3kJaDuPUF1Dqiu\nThe following files were successfully
