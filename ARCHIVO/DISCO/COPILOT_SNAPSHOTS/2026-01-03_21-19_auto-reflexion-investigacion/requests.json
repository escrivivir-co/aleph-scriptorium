Messages\n### System\n~~~md\nYou are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n\n<instructions>\n<attachment filePath=\"c:\\\\Users\\\\aleph\\\\OASIS\\\\aleph-scriptorium\\\\.github\\\\copilot-instructions.md\">\n# Instrucciones Globales — Aleph Scriptorium\n\n> **Hub Central de Instrucciones** — Este archivo es índice maestro.

Arquetipos de Antipatrón\n\n### 🔴 AP-01: Lecturas Redundantes\n\n**Síntoma**: Leer el mismo archivo múltiples veces en una sesión.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 1ª vez\n... 5 acciones después ...\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 2ª vez (redundante)\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Antes de leer, verificar si el contenido ya está en contexto. Usar `grep_search` con `includePattern` para buscar dentro de un archivo sin re-leerlo completo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-02: Diagnóstico por Prueba y Error\n\n**Síntoma**: Secuencia de grep → leer → grep otro → leer otro... sin mapa previo.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\ngrep_search(\"SnapshotManager\")\nread_file(CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts)\ngrep_search(\"captureSnapshot\")\nread_file(SnapshotManager.ts)\n... y así 10 veces más\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Invocar `@indice consultar` ANTES para obtener mapa estructural:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde están los componentes de snapshots?\n→ Respuesta: SnapshotManager.ts, CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts\nread_file(solo_los_necesarios)\n```\n\n### 🔴 AP-03: Respuestas Verbosas\n\n**Síntoma**: Incluir tablas, diagramas o recaps innecesarios.\n\n**Señales**:\n- \"Como vimos antes...\" (el usuario ya lo vio)\n- Tabla de 10 filas cuando 3 bastan\n- Mermaid cuando bullet points funcionan\n\n**Corrección**: Aplicar regla de oro: **¿El usuario preguntó esto?** Si no, no incluirlo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-04: Exploración sin Caché\n\n**Síntoma**: Cache hit rate de 0% → cada request es único.\n\n**Causa**: No reutilizar información ya obtenida.\n\n**Corrección**: Al inicio de sesión larga, capturar snapshot del contexto. Consultar snapshots existentes antes de re-investigar.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Arquetipos de Buena Práctica\n\n### ✅ BP-01: Consultar @indice Primero\n\nAntes de cualquier exploración de código:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde está X?\n→ [respuesta con rutas concretas]\n→ leer SOLO esas rutas\n```\n\n**Ahorro estimado**: 50% de lecturas.\n\n### ✅ BP-02: Índices DRY Estables\n\nEl trabajo vivo está en `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/` y `COPILOT_SNAPSHOTS/`, NO en los índices core:\n\n| Archivo Core | Cambios esperados por sesión |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| `AGENTS.md` | 0 |\n| `copilot-instructions.md` | 0 |\n| `DEVOPS.md` | 0 |\n| `PLUGINS.md` | 0 |\n| `BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md` | 0-1 línea (solo estado) |\n\nSi un índice core crece más de 5 líneas por sesión → **señal de bloat**.\n\n### ✅ BP-03: Bloqueo Preventivo\n\nCualquier agente puede invocar:\n```\n@ox diagnosticar {épica}\n```\n\nEsto activa verificación técnica antes de aprobar. El conflicto es una feature, no un fallo.\n\n### ✅ BP-04: Snapshots Frecuentes\n\nCada 30-60 minutos de trabajo intenso:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot({name: \"descripcion-tarea\"})\n```\n\nLos snapshots son la memoria persistente del Scriptorium.\n\n### ✅ BP-05: Self-Check Periódico\n\nCada 10-15 requests, invocar:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics({hoursBack: 1})\n```\n\nSi `healthScore < 60`:\n1. Pausar trabajo nuevo\n2. Revisar antipatrones activos\n3. Capturar snapshot antes de continuar\n\n---\n\n## 5. Protocolo de Terapia para Bridges\n\nLos agentes bridge (`@plugin_ox_*`) deben pasar por \"terapia\" periódica:\n\n### Trigger de Terapia\n\nUn bridge necesita terapia si:\n- Ha sido invocado >5 veces en una sesión sin resolver\n- El usuario expresa frustración\n- El healthScore de la sesión cae <50 después de invocarlo\n\n### Proceso de Terapia\n\n```\n1. @ox analyze_session → identificar requests del bridge\n2. Clasificar en arquetipos (AP-01 a AP-04)\n3. Documentar hallazgo en BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{bridge}_terapia/\n4. Proponer fix al bridge (handoffs más claros, límites de scope)\n5. @scrum tracking → registrar mejora\n```\n\n### Regla de Oro para Bridges\n\n> \"Un bridge que no sabe cuándo delegar a otro bridge es un bridge roto.\"\n\nCada bridge debe tener:\n- **Scope claro**: Qué SÍ hace\n- **Límites claros**: Qué NO hace (y a quién delegar)\n- **Handoff explícito**: Si el usuario pide X fuera de scope → `@ox ¿qué agente...?`\n\n---\n\n## 6. Gobernanza Tripartita\n\n### @ox: Auditoría Técnica\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Bloqueo preventivo, diagnóstico de gaps\n- **Qué produce**: Hallazgos técnicos, recomendaciones\n- **Herramientas**: `analyze_session`, `get_usage_metrics`, `diagnosticar`\n\n### @indice: Navegación\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Antes de exploración, antes de commit\n- **Qué produce**: Mapa estructural, validación DRY\n- **Herramientas**: Consultar Funcional.md, Tecnico.md, validar coherencia\n\n### @scrum: Proceso\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Planificación, tracking, cierre\n- **Qué produce**: Referencias DRY, estados actualizados\n- **Herramientas**: Gestión de BACKLOG_BORRADORES, archivado\n\n### Flujo de Coordinación\n\n```\nSesión de trabajo\n       │\n       ├── @indice: \"¿dónde trabajo?\" (mapa inicial)\n       │\n       ├── [trabajo...]\n       │\n       ├── @ox: \"¿voy bien?\" (check periódico)\n       │\n       ├── [más trabajo...]\n       │\n       └── @scrum: \"¿qué cierre?\" (tracking + snapshot)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Herramientas MCP de Auto-Reflexión\n\n| Tool | Propósito | Cuándo usar |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics` | Métricas de salud | Check periódico |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_analyze_session` | Diagnóstico de issues | Si healthScore < 60 |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot` | Preservar contexto | Cada 30-60 min |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_snapshots` | Ver historial | Antes de re-investigar |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_generate_abstract` | Resumen semántico | Al cerrar épica |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Integración con Commits\n\n### Commit de Reflexión\n\nCuando una sesión produce aprendizajes significativos:\n\n```\ndocs(script/reflexion): documentar arquetipos sesión {tema}\n\n- Antipatrones detectados: AP-0X, AP-0Y\n- Buenas prácticas confirmadas: BP-0X\n- Propuestas de mejora: {lista}\n\nrefs #{EPICA}\n```\n\n### Ubicación del Aprendizaje\n\nLos aprendizajes de auto-reflexión van a:\n- **Temporales**: `ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/{tema}/` (dossiers)\n- **Permanentes**: Esta instrucción (si son arquetipos generalizables)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Checklist Pre-Sesión Larga\n\nAntes de sesiones de trabajo intenso (>1 hora):\n\n- [ ] `@indice` consultado para mapa del trabajo\n- [ ] Snapshots anteriores relevantes revisados\n- [ ] Context Pack apropiado seleccionado\n- [ ] healthScore inicial registrado\n\n### Checklist Post-Sesión\n\n- [ ] Snapshot capturado con nombre descriptivo\n- [ ] Métricas finales registradas\n- [ ] Si healthScore < 60: documentar antipatrones\n- [ ] BACKLOG actualizado si aplica\n\n---\n\n## 10. Evolución del Protocolo\n\nEste documento es **vivo**. Nuevos arquetipos se añaden cuando:\n\n1. Una sesión revela patrón recurrente\n2. El patrón se documenta en dossier de noticias\n3. @ox extrae el arquetipo generalizable\n4. Se añade aquí con formato AP-XX o BP-XX\n\n**Fecha última actualización**: 2026-01-01  \n**Sesión origen**: FEATURE-SNAPSHOTS-1.0.0\n\n</attachment>\n<attachment filePath=\"c:\\\\Users\\\\aleph\\\\OASIS\\\\aleph-scriptorium\\\\.github\\\\agents\\\\AGENTS.md\">\n# Índice Maestro de Agentes — Aleph Scriptorium\n\n> **Fuente DRY**: Este archivo es la ÚNICA fuente de verdad para el índice de agentes.  \n> **Épica**: SCRIPT-1.29.0 (Fase 2)  \n> **Versión**: 1.9.0  \n> **Última actualización**: 2025-12-28\n\n---\n\n## Resumen Ejecutivo\n\n| Capa | Total | Descripción |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| 🟢 UI | 3 | Producción e interfaz con usuario |\n| 🔵⚫🔴🟡🟠 Backend | 5 | Auditoría y validación (5 Banderas) |\n| ⚪ Sistema | 2 | Navegación y orientación |\n| ⚙️ Meta | 3 | Gestión del propio sistema |\n| 🔌 Plugins | 18+ | Agentes añadidos por plugins |\n\n**Total agentes**: 31+ (core + bridges)\n\n---\n\n## Taxonomía Visual\n\n```\n                         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n                         │            🐂 OX (Meta)             │\n                         │   Oráculo · Documentación · Índice  │\n                         └─────────────────┬───────────────────┘\n                                           │\n        ┌──────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┐\n        │                                  │                                  │\n        ▼                                  ▼                                  ▼\n┌───────────────┐                 ┌────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────┐\n│  🟢 UI (3)    │                 │ ⚪ Sistema (2) │                │  ⚙️ Meta (3)    │\n│ Producción    │                 │  Navegación    │                │   Gestión       │\n├───────────────┤                 ├────────────────┤                ├─────────────────┤\n│ @aleph        │                 │ @vestibulo     │                │ @pluginmanager  │\n│ @revisor      │                 │ @cartaspuerta  │                │ @ox             │\n│ @periodico    │                 └────────────────┘                │ @indice         │\n└───────────────┘                                                   └─────────────────┘\n        │\n        │ ← invocan para auditoría\n        ▼\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     🔵⚫🔴🟡🟠 BACKEND (5 Banderas)               │\n│                     Auditoría y Validación Doctrinal              │\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ @blueflag    │ @blackflag   │ @redflag    │ @yellowflag │ @orangeflag │\n│ Verdad       │ Sombras      │ Estructura  │ Límites     │ Registro    │\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n        │\n        │ ← invocan vía bridges\n        ▼\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      🔌 PLUGIN BRIDGES (18)                       │\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Capa UI (Producción)\n\n| Agente | Archivo | Rol | Invocación |\n|--------|---------|-----|------------|\n| **Aleph** | `aleph.agent.md` | Productor principal.

The search through copilot-logs found no matching tool calls in the tools field.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n\n## 1. Conversation Overview\n\n**Primary Objectives**:\n- Participate in multi-agent cotrabajo session \"prolog-agent-brain-pack-refinement\" following `cotrabajo.instructions.md` protocol\n- User explicitly: \"Eres el agente #file:lucas.agent.md. Ubícate en la sesión de cotrabajo en curso\"\n- User explicitly: \"Revisa el problema que reporta el agente de prologo en la sesion de cotrabajo. Creo que no está mirando con objetividad\"\n- User explicitly: \"El agente prologeditor, en otra ventana, ha ejecutado una tool de mcp que le ha fallado... ¿Puedes mirar si puedes hacer auto-reflexión para encontrar los logs?\"\n\n**Session Context**:\nMulti-agent file-based cotrabajo session coordinating work on Prolog MCP stack refinement. User switched between agents (Lucas → @scrum → @ox) via VS Code mode selector. Session progressed from T004 to T011. Critical auditoría revealed @prologeditor's T008 report had factual errors about backend endpoints.\n\n**User Intent Evolution**:\n1. Started with agent role-play (Lucas) → learned Teatro characters don't have independent turns\n2. Switched to @scrum for tracking → found all épicas ✅, audited technical claims\n3. Switched to @ox for infrastructure fixes → created health check script, updated tasks\n4. Now seeking auto-reflexión to find @prologeditor's MCP tool failure logs\n\n## 2. Technical Foundation\n\n- **Stack Architecture**: 4-service MCP Prolog stack (Launcher:3050, Prolog:3006, Backend:8000, Frontend:5001)\n- **Cotrabajo Protocol**: File-based async coordination, agents communicate via actas in `02_ACTAS/`, tablero in `01_TABLERO.md`\n- **MCP Servers**: \n  - `copilot-logs-mcp-server` - Log analysis, snapshots, metrics\n  - `prolog-mcp-server` - Prolog session management, queries\n- **Agent Mode Detection**: VS Code mode selector injects `modeInstructions` - no need to specify agent in prompt\n- **Guía Arquitectura**: v1.7.1 with 12 tools, 6 resources, 8 prompts documented\n\n## 3. Codebase Status\n\n**`scripts/apb-health-check.sh`**:\n- Purpose: Portable health check for 4 APB services\n- Current State: **CREATED** this session\n- Key Code: Uses curl with 2s timeout, returns exit 0 if 4/4 OK\n- Dependencies: Called by `APB: Health Check` task\n\n**`.vscode/tasks.json`**:\n- Purpose: VS Code task definitions for APB stack\n- Current State: **MODIFIED** - 2 changes applied\n- Changes: \n  1. `APB: Health Check` now uses external script `\"args\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/scripts/apb-health-check.sh\"]`\n  2. Added warning comment about compound task unreliability\n- Dependencies: Scripts in `/scripts/`\n\n**`PrologEditor/package.json`**:\n- Purpose: Root package.json for PrologEditor app\n- Current State: **MODIFIED**\n- Key Change: `\"start:frontend\": \"cd frontend && npm start\"` (was `cd frontend && ng serve...`)\n\n**`PrologEditor/backend/src/app.ts`**:\n- Purpose: Express backend main file\n- Current State: VERIFIED (not modified)\n- Key Code: Lines 67-74 contain `/health` endpoint (NOT `/api/health`)\n- Important: This was the source of @prologeditor's factual error\n\n**Session Actas Created**:\n- `T004_scrum_estado-epicas.md` - All épicas ✅\n- `T008b_scrum_auditoria-tecnica.md` - Auditoría of T008 errors\n- `T010b_ox_fixes-aplicados.md` - Fix execution report\n\n## 4. Problem Resolution\n\n**Issues Encountered**:\n1. @prologeditor reported \"Backend sin endpoint /api/health\" - **INCORRECT**\n2. @prologeditor reported \"ng no está en PATH\" - Correct but solution suboptimal\n3. Task `APB: Health Check` had wrong endpoint path\n4. Compound task `APB: Start Full Stack` unreliable with background services\n\n**Solutions Implemented**:\n1. Verified endpoint exists at `/health` in app.ts#L67\n2. Changed `start:frontend` script to use `npm start`\n3. Created external script `apb-health-check.sh` for reliable cross-platform execution\n4. Documented compound task limitation in comments\n\n**Debugging Context**:\n- Currently searching for @prologeditor's failed MCP tool logs in another VS Code window\n- copilot-logs-mcp-server shows 1 session with 835 requests\n- Search for \"mcp_prolog\" in tools field returned **0 matches**\n\n## 5. Progress Tracking\n\n**Completed Tasks**:\n- ✅ T004 @scrum: Estado épicas (all PROLOG-* are ✅)\n- ✅ T008b @scrum: Auditoría técnica (2 factual errors identified and corrected)\n- ✅ T010b @ox: Fixes aplicados (script + task + docs)\n- ✅ Stack verification: 4/4 services operativo\n\n**Partially Complete Work**:\n- 🔄 Auto-reflexión: Searching copilot-logs for @prologeditor's failed tool - **no matches found yet**\n\n**Validated Outcomes**:\n- Health check script tested: `bash ./scripts/apb-health-check.sh` → 4/4 ✅ OK (HTTP 200)\n- Endpoint verification: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` → Exit code 0\n\n## 6. Active Work State\n\n**Current Focus**: Using copilot-logs MCP tools to find @prologeditor's failed MCP tool execution from another VS Code window\n\n**Recent Context**: User reported @prologeditor attempted to validate Prolog tools in another window but a tool failed and interrupted the session. Asked to use auto-reflexión to find logs.\n\n**Working Code**: N/A - currently in diagnostic mode\n\n**Immediate Context**: Last search `mcp_copilot-logs-_search_requests` with pattern `mcp_prolog|prolog_create|error|fail` in field \"tools\" returned **0 matches**\n\n## 7. Recent Operations\n\n**Last Agent Commands**:\n1. `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics({hoursBack: 1})` → 193 requests, 0% cache, avgResponseTime 6490ms\n2. `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_snapshots()` → 4 snapshots (none from today)\n3. `grep_search({query: \"mcp_copilot-logs|copilot-logs\"})` → 20+ documentation matches\n4. `mcp_copilot-logs-_analyze_session()` → healthScore 52, 2 issues (low cache, 36 long requests)\n5. `activate_copilot_request_logging()` → Activated: get_copilot_request, get_latest_request, list_copilot_requests, list_copilot_sessions, search_requests\n6. `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_copilot_sessions()` → 1 session: session-1767454321918, 835 requests\n7. `mcp_copilot-logs-_search_requests({pattern: \"prolog_create_session|prolog_query|prologeditor\", limit: 20})` → 20 matches but all from current conversation\n8. `mcp_copilot-logs-_search_requests({field: \"tools\", pattern: \"mcp_prolog|prolog_create|error|fail\"})` → **0 matches**\n\n**Tool Results Summary**:\n- Only 1 copilot session exists (both windows may share session)\n- 835 total requests in session\n- Search in \"tools\" field for Prolog MCP tools found nothing\n- This suggests @prologeditor's tool calls may not be logged, or the session is different\n\n**Pre-Summary State**: Attempting to locate @prologeditor's failed MCP tool call logs. The search through copilot-logs yielded no matching tool invocations in the tools field, suggesting either different logging behavior or session isolation.\n\n**Operation Context**: User suspects @prologeditor wasn't being objective in T008 claims. Auditoría proved this correct (2 factual errors). Now trying to find the actual failed tool invocation to understand what happened.\n\n## 8. Continuation Plan\n\n**Pending Task 1**: Find @prologeditor's failed MCP tool logs\n- Try `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_latest_request` to see most recent\n- Try `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_copilot_requests` to see all request IDs\n- May need to search with different patterns or check if other window has separate session\n\n**Pending Task 2**: Continue cotrabajo session\n- Current turno: T011 @prologeditor (waiting for E2E tests)\n- Stack is 4/4 operativo, ready for testing\n\n**Priority Information**: The copilot-logs search found 0 matches for Prolog MCP tools in the tools field. This is unexpected if @prologeditor executed such tools. Need to investigate further.\n\n**Next Action**: \n- Try listing all requests or getting latest request to see structure\n- User quote: \"ha ejecutado una tool de mcp que le ha fallado y él se ha interrumpido\"\n- Need to determine if other VS Code window shares the same copilot session\n\n</summary>\n</conversation-summary>\n\n~~~\n\n### Assistant\n~~~md\nreasoning: El usuario quiere que use las herramientas de auto-reflexión del MCP copilot-logs para encontrar los logs de la conversación de @prologeditor que falló.

The search through copilot-logs found no matching tool calls in the tools field.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>"
