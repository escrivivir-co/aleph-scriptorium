This functionality is particularly useful for developers and researchers working with Prolog, as it facilitates the organization and manipulation of logical data and rules.\\n\\nThe 'mcp_prolog-mcp-se_prolog_create_session' tool initiates a new Prolog session, providing a clean environment for users to work on specific projects or queries. Once a session is created, users can utilize the 'mcp_prolog-mcp-se_prolog_consult_file' tool to load Prolog files, which contain facts and rules that the session can use to answer queries or perform logical deductions.\\n\\nTo keep track of ongoing work, the 'mcp_prolog-mcp-se_prolog_list_sessions' tool allows users to view all active Prolog sessions. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where multiple projects or experiments are being conducted simultaneously, as it helps in managing resources effectively.\\n\\nFinally, the 'mcp_prolog-mcp-se_prolog_query' tool enables users to execute specific queries within the selected session. This is where the power of Prolog comes into play, allowing users to retrieve information, infer new knowledge, or validate logical statements based on the loaded data.\\n\\nTogether, these tools create a cohesive environment for working with Prolog, making it easier to manage sessions, load necessary data, and perform complex queries, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency in logical programming tasks.\\n\\nBe sure to call this tool if you need a capability related to the above.\"\n        },\n        \"type\": \"function\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"activate_sdk_template_management_tools\",\n            \"description\": \"Call this tool when you need access to a new category of tools.

Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n\n<instructions>\n<attachment filePath=\"c:\\\\Users\\\\aleph\\\\OASIS\\\\aleph-scriptorium\\\\.github\\\\copilot-instructions.md\">\n# Instrucciones Globales — Aleph Scriptorium\n\n> **Hub Central de Instrucciones** — Este archivo es índice maestro.

Arquetipos de Antipatrón\n\n### 🔴 AP-01: Lecturas Redundantes\n\n**Síntoma**: Leer el mismo archivo múltiples veces en una sesión.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 1ª vez\n... 5 acciones después ...\nread_file(01_backlog-borrador.md)  ← 2ª vez (redundante)\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Antes de leer, verificar si el contenido ya está en contexto. Usar `grep_search` con `includePattern` para buscar dentro de un archivo sin re-leerlo completo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-02: Diagnóstico por Prueba y Error\n\n**Síntoma**: Secuencia de grep → leer → grep otro → leer otro... sin mapa previo.\n\n**Ejemplo malo**:\n```\ngrep_search(\"SnapshotManager\")\nread_file(CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts)\ngrep_search(\"captureSnapshot\")\nread_file(SnapshotManager.ts)\n... y así 10 veces más\n```\n\n**Corrección**: Invocar `@indice consultar` ANTES para obtener mapa estructural:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde están los componentes de snapshots?\n→ Respuesta: SnapshotManager.ts, CopilotLogsMCPServer.ts\nread_file(solo_los_necesarios)\n```\n\n### 🔴 AP-03: Respuestas Verbosas\n\n**Síntoma**: Incluir tablas, diagramas o recaps innecesarios.\n\n**Señales**:\n- \"Como vimos antes...\" (el usuario ya lo vio)\n- Tabla de 10 filas cuando 3 bastan\n- Mermaid cuando bullet points funcionan\n\n**Corrección**: Aplicar regla de oro: **¿El usuario preguntó esto?** Si no, no incluirlo.\n\n### 🔴 AP-04: Exploración sin Caché\n\n**Síntoma**: Cache hit rate de 0% → cada request es único.\n\n**Causa**: No reutilizar información ya obtenida.\n\n**Corrección**: Al inicio de sesión larga, capturar snapshot del contexto. Consultar snapshots existentes antes de re-investigar.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Arquetipos de Buena Práctica\n\n### ✅ BP-01: Consultar @indice Primero\n\nAntes de cualquier exploración de código:\n```\n@indice ¿dónde está X?\n→ [respuesta con rutas concretas]\n→ leer SOLO esas rutas\n```\n\n**Ahorro estimado**: 50% de lecturas.\n\n### ✅ BP-02: Índices DRY Estables\n\nEl trabajo vivo está en `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/` y `COPILOT_SNAPSHOTS/`, NO en los índices core:\n\n| Archivo Core | Cambios esperados por sesión |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| `AGENTS.md` | 0 |\n| `copilot-instructions.md` | 0 |\n| `DEVOPS.md` | 0 |\n| `PLUGINS.md` | 0 |\n| `BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md` | 0-1 línea (solo estado) |\n\nSi un índice core crece más de 5 líneas por sesión → **señal de bloat**.\n\n### ✅ BP-03: Bloqueo Preventivo\n\nCualquier agente puede invocar:\n```\n@ox diagnosticar {épica}\n```\n\nEsto activa verificación técnica antes de aprobar. El conflicto es una feature, no un fallo.\n\n### ✅ BP-04: Snapshots Frecuentes\n\nCada 30-60 minutos de trabajo intenso:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot({name: \"descripcion-tarea\"})\n```\n\nLos snapshots son la memoria persistente del Scriptorium.\n\n### ✅ BP-05: Self-Check Periódico\n\nCada 10-15 requests, invocar:\n```\nmcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics({hoursBack: 1})\n```\n\nSi `healthScore < 60`:\n1. Pausar trabajo nuevo\n2. Revisar antipatrones activos\n3. Capturar snapshot antes de continuar\n\n### ✅ BP-06: Cacheo Bajo Demanda (CRÍTICO)\n\n> **Origen**: Sesión AUTO-REFLEXION-FC1 (2026-01-04)\n\n**Problema**: Los snapshots solo capturan requests que están en el caché de contenido. Los request IDs antiguos existen en el log pero su **contenido ya no es accesible** via `ccreq:` URI.\n\n**Solución**: Cachear bajo demanda ANTES de tomar el snapshot:\n\n```\n# Paso 1: Cachear la conversación actual\nmcp_copilot-logs-_get_latest_request()\n\n# Paso 2: Ahora sí, capturar snapshot (incluirá lo cacheado)\nmcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot({name: \"descripcion\"})\n```\n\n**Por qué funciona**:\n- `get_latest_request()` resuelve el `ccreq:` URI del request actual y lo cachea\n- `capture_snapshot()` persiste todo lo que esté en caché\n- El caché tiene límite de 50 entries (configurable con `configure_cache`)\n\n**Flujo completo para auto-reflexión**:\n\n```\n1. get_usage_metrics()      → Diagnóstico de salud\n2. get_latest_request()     → Cachea conversación actual\n3. capture_snapshot()       → Persiste todo lo cacheado\n4. generate_abstract()      → Resumen semántico (opcional)\n```\n\n**Limitación conocida**: Los requests antiguos (>30 min) ya no son accesibles aunque sus IDs existan. La memoria del `ccreq:` provider es volátil.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Protocolo de Terapia para Bridges\n\nLos agentes bridge (`@plugin_ox_*`) deben pasar por \"terapia\" periódica:\n\n### Trigger de Terapia\n\nUn bridge necesita terapia si:\n- Ha sido invocado >5 veces en una sesión sin resolver\n- El usuario expresa frustración\n- El healthScore de la sesión cae <50 después de invocarlo\n\n### Proceso de Terapia\n\n```\n1. @ox analyze_session → identificar requests del bridge\n2. Clasificar en arquetipos (AP-01 a AP-04)\n3. Documentar hallazgo en BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{bridge}_terapia/\n4. Proponer fix al bridge (handoffs más claros, límites de scope)\n5. @scrum tracking → registrar mejora\n```\n\n### Regla de Oro para Bridges\n\n> \"Un bridge que no sabe cuándo delegar a otro bridge es un bridge roto.\"\n\nCada bridge debe tener:\n- **Scope claro**: Qué SÍ hace\n- **Límites claros**: Qué NO hace (y a quién delegar)\n- **Handoff explícito**: Si el usuario pide X fuera de scope → `@ox ¿qué agente...?`\n\n---\n\n## 6. Gobernanza Tripartita\n\n### @ox: Auditoría Técnica\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Bloqueo preventivo, diagnóstico de gaps\n- **Qué produce**: Hallazgos técnicos, recomendaciones\n- **Herramientas**: `analyze_session`, `get_usage_metrics`, `diagnosticar`\n\n### @indice: Navegación\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Antes de exploración, antes de commit\n- **Qué produce**: Mapa estructural, validación DRY\n- **Herramientas**: Consultar Funcional.md, Tecnico.md, validar coherencia\n\n### @scrum: Proceso\n\n- **Cuándo actúa**: Planificación, tracking, cierre\n- **Qué produce**: Referencias DRY, estados actualizados\n- **Herramientas**: Gestión de BACKLOG_BORRADORES, archivado\n\n### Flujo de Coordinación\n\n```\nSesión de trabajo\n       │\n       ├── @indice: \"¿dónde trabajo?\" (mapa inicial)\n       │\n       ├── [trabajo...]\n       │\n       ├── @ox: \"¿voy bien?\" (check periódico)\n       │\n       ├── [más trabajo...]\n       │\n       └── @scrum: \"¿qué cierre?\" (tracking + snapshot)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Herramientas MCP de Auto-Reflexión\n\n| Tool | Propósito | Cuándo usar |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_usage_metrics` | Métricas de salud | Check periódico |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_analyze_session` | Diagnóstico de issues | Si healthScore < 60 |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_get_latest_request` | **Cachear conversación actual** | **ANTES de snapshot** (BP-06) |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_capture_snapshot` | Preservar contexto cacheado | Cada 30-60 min |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_list_snapshots` | Ver historial | Antes de re-investigar |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_generate_abstract` | Resumen semántico | Al cerrar épica |\n| `mcp_copilot-logs-_configure_cache` | Ajustar tamaño caché (default: 50) | Si necesitas más historial |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Integración con Commits\n\n### Commit de Reflexión\n\nCuando una sesión produce aprendizajes significativos:\n\n```\ndocs(script/reflexion): documentar arquetipos sesión {tema}\n\n- Antipatrones detectados: AP-0X, AP-0Y\n- Buenas prácticas confirmadas: BP-0X\n- Propuestas de mejora: {lista}\n\nrefs #{EPICA}\n```\n\n### Ubicación del Aprendizaje\n\nLos aprendizajes de auto-reflexión van a:\n- **Temporales**: `ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/{tema}/` (dossiers)\n- **Permanentes**: Esta instrucción (si son arquetipos generalizables)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Checklist Pre-Sesión Larga\n\nAntes de sesiones de trabajo intenso (>1 hora):\n\n- [ ] `@indice` consultado para mapa del trabajo\n- [ ] Snapshots anteriores relevantes revisados\n- [ ] Context Pack apropiado seleccionado\n- [ ] healthScore inicial registrado\n\n### Checklist Post-Sesión\n\n- [ ] Snapshot capturado con nombre descriptivo\n- [ ] Métricas finales registradas\n- [ ] Si healthScore < 60: documentar antipatrones\n- [ ] BACKLOG actualizado si aplica\n\n---\n\n## 10. Evolución del Protocolo\n\nEste documento es **vivo**. Nuevos arquetipos se añaden cuando:\n\n1. Una sesión revela patrón recurrente\n2. El patrón se documenta en dossier de noticias\n3. @ox extrae el arquetipo generalizable\n4. Se añade aquí con formato AP-XX o BP-XX\n\n**Fecha última actualización**: 2026-01-04  \n**Sesión origen**: FEATURE-SNAPSHOTS-1.0.0, AUTO-REFLEXION-FC1\n\n</attachment>\n<attachment filePath=\"c:\\\\Users\\\\aleph\\\\OASIS\\\\aleph-scriptorium\\\\.github\\\\agents\\\\AGENTS.md\">\n# Índice Maestro de Agentes — Aleph Scriptorium\n\n> **Fuente DRY**: Este archivo es la ÚNICA fuente de verdad para el índice de agentes.  \n> **Épica**: SCRIPT-1.29.0 (Fase 2)  \n> **Versión**: 1.9.0  \n> **Última actualización**: 2025-12-28\n\n---\n\n## Resumen Ejecutivo\n\n| Capa | Total | Descripción |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| 🟢 UI | 3 | Producción e interfaz con usuario |\n| 🔵⚫🔴🟡🟠 Backend | 5 | Auditoría y validación (5 Banderas) |\n| ⚪ Sistema | 2 | Navegación y orientación |\n| ⚙️ Meta | 3 | Gestión del propio sistema |\n| 🔌 Plugins | 18+ | Agentes añadidos por plugins |\n\n**Total agentes**: 31+ (core + bridges)\n\n---\n\n## Taxonomía Visual\n\n```\n                         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n                         │            🐂 OX (Meta)             │\n                         │   Oráculo · Documentación · Índice  │\n                         └─────────────────┬───────────────────┘\n                                           │\n        ┌──────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┐\n        │                                  │                                  │\n        ▼                                  ▼                                  ▼\n┌───────────────┐                 ┌────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────┐\n│  🟢 UI (3)    │                 │ ⚪ Sistema (2) │                │  ⚙️ Meta (3)    │\n│ Producción    │                 │  Navegación    │                │   Gestión       │\n├───────────────┤                 ├────────────────┤                ├─────────────────┤\n│ @aleph        │                 │ @vestibulo     │                │ @pluginmanager  │\n│ @revisor      │                 │ @cartaspuerta  │                │ @ox             │\n│ @periodico    │                 └────────────────┘                │ @indice         │\n└───────────────┘                                                   └─────────────────┘\n        │\n        │ ← invocan para auditoría\n        ▼\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     🔵⚫🔴🟡🟠 BACKEND (5 Banderas)               │\n│                     Auditoría y Validación Doctrinal              │\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ @blueflag    │ @blackflag   │ @redflag    │ @yellowflag │ @orangeflag │\n│ Verdad       │ Sombras      │ Estructura  │ Límites     │ Registro    │\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n        │\n        │ ← invocan vía bridges\n        ▼\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      🔌 PLUGIN BRIDGES (18)                       │\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Capa UI (Producción)\n\n| Agente | Archivo | Rol | Invocación |\n|--------|---------|-----|------------|\n| **Aleph** | `aleph.agent.md` | Productor principal.

Created LAUNCHER-BUG-001 bug report, applied cross-platform fix using `killProcessTree()` with Windows taskkill and Unix process.kill(-pid).\n\n2. **Cotrabajo Session Setup**: User directed work to `ARCHIVO\\DISCO\\SESIONES_COTRABAJO\\2026-01-04_typed-mcp-test-session` following protocol.\n\n3. **T001-T003 (from summary)**: Fixed compilation errors, verified LAUNCHER-BUG-001 fix, integrated TypedPrompt MCP Server in Launcher, executed TC-001 to TC-007 tests (6/7 pass).\n\n4. **T004 Review**: @aleph reviewed decisions, confirmed spec fix for `/convert` endpoint, asked for confirmation.\n\n5. **Premature Session Close**: @ox incorrectly closed session, but @aleph reopened it with T005 gap analysis.\n\n6. **T005 Gap Analysis**: @aleph identified missing test coverage - UI tests, MCP Resources, MCP Prompts, E2E with Copilot. Assigned TC-UI-001 to TC-UI-004, TC-R01/R02, TC-P01 to TC-P03, TC-E2E-001.\n\n7. **T006 Gap Tests Execution**: \n   - TC-UI-001: PASS (HTTP 200)\n   - TC-R01/R02: FAIL (resources not found - BUG-TPE-003 discovered)\n   - TC-P01/P02/P03: PASS (all prompts work)\n   - TC-E2E-001: CONFIG OK (mcp.json has server)\n\n8. **BUG-TPE-003 Investigation & Fix**: User asked if bug could be fixed. Investigation revealed the `server.resource()` signature was wrong - parameters were in wrong order:\n   - **Wrong**: `resource(uri, description, handler)`\n   - **Correct**: `resource(name, uri, {description, mimeType}, handler)`\n\n9. **Fix Applied**: Corrected all 3 resources in MCPTypedPromptServer.ts, rebuilt, restarted servers.\n\n10. **Verification**: TC-R01 now passes with 5 schemas returned. TC-R02 (template with {id}) still failing.\n\n## Intent Mapping\n\n- Fix BUG-TPE-003 (resources not found)\n- Complete gap analysis tests\n- Get all MCP capabilities working for demo\n\n## Technical Inventory\n\n- **MCPTypedPromptServer**: MCP wrapper for TypedPrompts backend\n- **server.resource()** signature: `(name, uri, {description, mimeType}, handler)`\n- **Resource templates**: `{id}` in URI requires special handling\n- **Ports**: Launcher=3050, TypedPrompt MCP=3020, TypedPrompt Backend=3019\n\n## Code Archaeology\n\n### MCPTypedPromptServer.ts - Resources Fix\n**Before (buggy)**:\n```typescript\nthis.server.resource(\n    \"typed-prompt://schemas/{id}\",  // treated as name\n    \"Get schema details by ID\",     // treated as uri\n    async (uri) => { ... }\n)\n```\n\n**After (fixed)**:\n```typescript\nthis.server.resource(\n    \"typed-prompt-schema\",              // name\n    \"typed-prompt://schemas/{id}\",      // uri\n    {\n        description: \"Get schema details by ID\",\n        mimeType: \"application/json\",\n    },\n    async (uri) => { ... }\n)\n```\n\nSame fix applied to:\n- `typed-prompt-library` for `typed-prompt://libraries/{id}`\n- `typed-prompt-schemas-list` for `typed-prompt://schemas`\n\n## Progress Assessment\n\n**Completed:**\n- ✅ BUG-TPE-003 root cause identified (parameter order)\n- ✅ Fix applied to all 3 resources\n- ✅ Build successful\n- ✅ TC-R01 now passes (schemas list via resource)\n\n**Partially Complete:**\n- 🔄 TC-R02 still failing (template resource with {id})\n\n**Pending:**\n- Resource template handling for dynamic IDs\n- Acta T007 with BUG-TPE-003 fix results\n\n## Recent Commands Analysis\n\n### Last Agent Commands:\n1. `run_task` - Started MCP Launcher\n2. `run_in_terminal` - Verified TypedPrompt health (failed, server down)\n3. `run_in_terminal` - Launched TypedPrompt via Launcher → PID 18656\n4. `run_in_terminal` - **TC-R01**: `resources/read` for `typed-prompt://schemas`\n5. `run_in_terminal` - **TC-R02**: `resources/read` for `typed-prompt://schemas/1`\n6. `run_in_terminal` - Check Prolog `resources/templates/list`\n\n### Key Tool Results:\n\n**TC-R01 (PASS)**:\n```json\n{\"result\":{\"contents\":[{\"uri\":\"typed-prompt://schemas\",\"mimeType\":\"application/json\",\"text\":\"{\\n  \\\"success\\\": true,\\n  \\\"count\\\": 5,\\n  \\\"schemas\\\": [...]}]}}\n```\n\n**TC-R02 (FAIL)**:\n```json\n{\"error\":{\"code\":-32602,\"message\":\"MCP error -32602: Resource typed-prompt://schemas/1 not found\"}}\n```\n\n**Prolog templates/list**:\n```json\n{\"result\":{\"resourceTemplates\":[]},\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1}\n```\n\n### Pre-Summary State:\nAgent was investigating why TC-R02 (resource with `{id}` template) fails even after fixing the parameter order. Was checking how Prolog handles resource templates - discovered Prolog has empty resourceTemplates array, suggesting templates may need different registration method.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n\n## 1. Conversation Overview\n\n- **Primary Objectives**: \n  - \"Revisión técnica de los metodos start/restart/stop del MCP Server\" - fix spawn process kill issues\n  - \"Revisa la carpeta de cotrabajo\" - follow cotrabajo protocol with actas\n  - \"¿Qué dices de BUG-TPE-003? ¿Se puede solucionar?\" - fix resources not found bug\n\n- **Session Context**: Multi-turno cotrabajo session for testing MCPTypedPromptServer integration. Started with LAUNCHER-BUG-001 fix, progressed through test execution (TC-001 to TC-007), gap analysis by PO, and now fixing BUG-TPE-003 (resources registration bug).\n\n- **User Intent Evolution**: Initial bug fix → Test execution → Gap analysis → Full demo readiness with all MCP capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)\n\n## 2. Technical Foundation\n\n- **MCPTypedPromptServer**: MCP server wrapping TypedPromptsEditor backend, port 3020\n- **TypedPromptsEditor Backend**: Express server on port 3019 with SQLite storage\n- **MCP Launcher**: Process manager on port 3050\n- **MCP SDK resource() signature**: `(name, uri, {description, mimeType}, handler)` - NOT `(uri, description, handler)`\n- **Cotrabajo Protocol**: Turnos with actas in `02_ACTAS/`, tablero tracking, states (⏳→✍️→✅)\n\n## 3. Codebase Status\n\n### MCPTypedPromptServer.ts\n- **Purpose**: MCP server exposing TypedPrompts via tools, resources, and prompts\n- **Current State**: Resources fixed with correct parameter order\n- **Key Code Changes (lines ~204-265)**:\n  ```typescript\n  // Fixed resource registration:\n  this.server.resource(\n      \"typed-prompt-schema\",           // name (was uri)\n      \"typed-prompt://schemas/{id}\",   // uri (was description)\n      { description: \"...\", mimeType: \"application/json\" },\n      async (uri) => { ... }\n  )\n  ```\n- **3 Resources Fixed**: typed-prompt-schema, typed-prompt-library, typed-prompt-schemas-list\n\n### TypedPromptBackendClient.ts (from previous session)\n- **Purpose**: HTTP client for backend REST API\n- **Fixed**: `getAllSchemas()` now correctly parses array response (was expecting `{schemas:[]}`)\n\n### convert.routes.ts (created)\n- **Purpose**: New endpoint `/api/convert` for TypeScript→JSON Schema conversion\n- **Current State**: Working, registered in routes.ts\n\n## 4. Problem Resolution\n\n### BUG-TPE-003: Resources Not Found (FIXED for static URIs)\n\n**Root Cause**: Parameters to `server.resource()` were in wrong order:\n- Code used: `(uri, description, handler)` \n- SDK expects: `(name, uri, metadata, handler)`\n\n**Discovery Method**: Compared with working PrologServer resources registration\n\n**Fix Applied**: Reordered parameters for all 3 resources in `setupResources()`\n\n**Verification**: \n- `resources/list` now returns correct `uri`/`name` fields\n- TC-R01 (`typed-prompt://schemas`) now PASSES with 5 schemas\n\n### Remaining Issue: Template Resources\n- TC-R02 (`typed-prompt://schemas/1`) still fails\n- Template with `{id}` placeholder not being matched\n- Investigation ongoing - Prolog also has empty `resourceTemplates[]`\n\n## 5. Progress Tracking\n\n- **Completed Tasks**:\n  - ✅ LAUNCHER-BUG-001 cross-platform kill\n  - ✅ BUG-TPE-001 getAllSchemas response parsing\n  - ✅ BUG-TPE-002 /api/convert endpoint\n  - ✅ BUG-TPE-003 resources parameter order (partial - static URIs work)\n  - ✅ TC-001 to TC-007 (6/7 pass)\n  - ✅ TC-P01 to TC-P03 (all prompts pass)\n  - ✅ TC-R01 (schemas list resource - NOW PASSING)\n\n- **Partially Complete**:\n  - 🔄 TC-R02 (schema by ID resource - template not matching)\n\n- **Validated Outcomes**:\n  - `resources/list` returns correct format\n  - `resources/read` for static URI works\n  - All 7 tools functional\n  - All 3 prompts functional\n\n## 6. Active Work State\n\n- **Current Focus**: Investigating why resource templates with `{id}` don't match\n- **Recent Context**: Fixed static resources, but dynamic template `typed-prompt://schemas/{id}` doesn't resolve `typed-prompt://schemas/1`\n- **Working Code**: `setupResources()` in MCPTypedPromptServer.ts\n- **Immediate Context**: Checked Prolog server's `resources/templates/list` - returns empty array, suggesting templates may need different API\n\n## 7. Recent Operations\n\n- **Last Agent Commands**:\n  1. `run_task \"shell: APB: Start [MCP Launcher]\"` - Launcher was down, restarted\n  2. `run_in_terminal` health check 3020 - failed (server down)\n  3. `run_in_terminal` launch via Launcher → success, PID 18656\n  4. `run_in_terminal` TC-R01 `resources/read typed-prompt://schemas` → **PASS** (5 schemas)\n  5. `run_in_terminal` TC-R02 `resources/read typed-prompt://schemas/1` → **FAIL** (not found)\n  6. `run_in_terminal` Prolog `resources/templates/list` → empty array\n\n- **Tool Results Summary**:\n  - TC-R01: `{\"success\": true, \"count\": 5, \"schemas\": [...]}`\n  - TC-R02: `{\"error\":{\"code\":-32602,\"message\":\"Resource typed-prompt://schemas/1 not found\"}}`\n  - Prolog templates: `{\"resourceTemplates\":[]}`\n\n- **Pre-Summary State**: Investigating resource template handling - why `{id}` pattern in URI doesn't match actual requests like `/schemas/1`\n\n- **Operation Context**: Part of T006/T007 gap test execution to achieve demo readiness\n\n## 8. Continuation Plan\n\n- **Pending Task 1**: Fix resource template matching for `typed-prompt://schemas/{id}`\n  - May need `resourceTemplate()` instead of `resource()` for dynamic URIs\n  - Or pattern matching in handler\n\n- **Pending Task 2**: Complete T007 acta documenting BUG-TPE-003 fix\n\n- **Pending Task 3**: Update tablero with T007 results\n\n- **Priority Information**: Template resources are medium priority - tools `typed_get_schema` and `typed_list_schemas` work as alternative\n\n- **Next Action**: Investigate MCP SDK documentation for resource templates vs static resources. The static resource `typed-prompt://schemas` works, so may need to register templates differently or use regex matching in the resource handler.\n\n## Key Files Modified This Session\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| MCPTypedPromptServer.ts | Fixed resource() parameter order for 3 resources |\n| convert.routes.ts | Created (new endpoint) |\n| routes.ts | Added convertRoutes import/registration |\n| TypedPromptBackendClient.ts | Fixed getAllSchemas response parsing |\n| T006_ox_gap-tests-execution.md | Created (gap test results) |\n| 01_TABLERO.md | Updated with T006/T007 |\n\n## Server Status\n\n| Service | Port | Status |\n|---------|------|--------|\n| MCP Launcher | 3050 | ✅ Running |\n| TypedPrompt MCP | 3020 | ✅ Running (PID 18656) |\n| TypedPrompt Backend | 3019 | ✅ Running |\n| Prolog MCP | 3006 | ✅ Running |\n\n</summary>\n</conversation-summary>\n\n~~~\n\n### Assistant\n~~~md\nLos templates no están registrados.

El fix de BUG-TPE-003 está completo. Resumen final:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ BUG-TPE-003 SOLUCIONADO\n\n### Root Cause\nEl MCP SDK distingue entre:\n- **Resources estáticos**: URIs fijas → `server.resource(name, \"uri://path\", metadata, callback)`\n- **Resource Templates**: URIs con `{variables}` → `server.resource(name, new ResourceTemplate(\"uri://{id}\", { list: undefined }), metadata, callback)`\n\n### Fix Aplicado\n1. **Import**: `import { ResourceTemplate } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp\"`\n2. **Refactor**: 2 resources dinámicos ahora usan `new ResourceTemplate()`\n3. **Callback signature**: `async (uri, { id }) => { ... }` - el SDK extrae variables automáticamente\n\n### Verificación\n\n| Test Case | Resultado |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| TC-R01 (schemas list) | ✅ PASS |\n| TC-R02 (schema by ID) | ✅ PASS |\n| `resources/templates/list` | ✅ 2 templates registrados |\n\n### Recursos MCP del TypedPrompt Server\n\n| Tipo | Nombre | URI/Template |\n|------|--------|--------------|\n| Static | typed-prompt-schemas-list | `typed-prompt://schemas` |\n| Template | typed-prompt-schema | `typed-prompt://schemas/{id}` |\n| Template | typed-prompt-library | `typed-prompt://libraries/{id}` |\n\nLa sesión ahora tiene **12/17 tests auto-pass (71%)** y **4 bugs corregidos**.\n~~~\n\n### User\n~~~md\n<context>\nThe current date is January 4, 2026.\nTerminals:\nTerminal: bash\nTerminal: bash\nLast Command: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3020/mcp -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Accept: application/json, text/event-stream\" -d \"{\\\"jsonrpc\\\":\\\"2.0\\\",\\\"method\\\":\\\"resources/list\\\",\\\"id\\\":1}\"\nCwd: C:/Users/aleph/OASIS/aleph-scriptorium/MCPGallery/mcp-mesh-sdk\nExit Code: 0\nTerminal: bash\nLast Command: cd /c/Users/aleph/OASIS/aleph-scriptorium/MCPGallery/mcp-mesh-sdk && git log --oneline -3\nCwd: C:/Users/aleph/OASIS/aleph-scriptorium/MCPGallery\nExit Code: 0\n<todoList>\nError: todoList is required for write operation\n</todoList>\n\n</context>\n<reminderInstructions>\nWhen using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.\nFor maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially.
