## Request Messages
### System
~~~md
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5.
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section
<fileLinkification>
When mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.
NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:
- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.
- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.

REQUIRED FORMATS:
- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)
- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)
- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)

PATH RULES:
- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.
- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.
- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.
- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://
- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).
- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.
- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).
- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.
- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)
- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.

FORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):
- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.
- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.
- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.
- Specific line citations without links ("Line 86", "at line 86", "on line 25").
- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)


</fileLinkification>
Use KaTeX for math equations in your answers.
Wrap inline math equations in $.
Wrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.

</outputFormatting>

# Protocolo de Plugins — Aleph Scriptorium

> **Resumen**: Protocolo para crear, instalar y gestionar plugins. Los plugins extienden capacidades sin modificar el núcleo.

**Versión**: 1.0.0  
**Agente gestor**: `@pluginmanager`

---

## Referencia Rápida

### Ubicaciones

| Tipo | Ubicación | Convención |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Código | `.github/plugins/{id}/` | kebab-case |
| Datos | `ARCHIVO/PLUGINS/{ID}/` | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE |
| Bridges | `.github/agents/plugin_ox_{id}.agent.md` | — |

### Estructura Mínima

```
mi-plugin/
├── manifest.md           # Obligatorio (frontmatter YAML)
└── agents/
    └── mi-agente.agent.md
```

### Manifest (frontmatter)

```yaml
---
id: mi-plugin
name: "Mi Plugin"
version: "1.0.0"
scriptorium_version: ">=0.0.1"
agents:
  - name: "NombreAgente"
    file: "agents/mi-agente.agent.md"
---
```

## Comandos de @pluginmanager

| Comando | Descripción |
|---------|-------------|
| `instalar <ruta>` | Instala plugin desde ruta local |
| `listar` | Muestra plugins con estado |
| `activar <id>` | Activa en settings.json |
| `desactivar <id>` | Desactiva en settings.json |
| `status` | Diagnóstico: activos, umbrales |
| `desinstalar <id>` | Elimina completamente |

---

## Flujo de Instalación

```
1. Validar manifest.md
2. Copiar a .github/plugins/{id}/
3. Crear bridge: plugin_ox_{id}.agent.md
4. Registrar en registry.json
5. Actualizar settings.json (desactivado por defecto)
6. Commit según DEVOPS.md
```

---

## Umbrales de Plugins Activos

| Plugins | Estado | Efecto |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 0-3 | 🟢 Óptimo | Sin impacto |
| 4-6 | �� Aceptable | Mínimo impacto |
| 7-10 | 🟠 Cargado | Posible lentitud |
| 11+ | 🔴 Sobrecargado | Desactivar algunos |

---

## Bridges Instalados

| Bridge | Plugin | Agentes |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `@plugin_ox_argboard` | ARG Board | 8 agentes |
| `@plugin_ox_enciclopedia` | Enciclopedia | 2 agentes |
| `@plugin_ox_ghpages` | GH-Pages | 1 agente |

## Ciclo de Vida

```
EXTERNO → INSTALADO (disabled) ↔ ENABLED → REMOVED
```

### Activación en Settings

```json
{
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": {
    ".github/plugins/{id}/prompts": true
  },
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    ".github/plugins/{id}/instructions": true
  }
}
```

## Permisos

| Recurso | Permiso |
|---------|---------|
| `.github/plugins/{id}/` | RW (su carpeta) |
| `registry.json` | R (solo lectura) |
| Otros plugins | ❌ No acceso |

---

## Convenciones de Nombres

| Recurso | Convención | Ejemplo |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Plugin ID | kebab-case | `arg-board` |
| Agentes | PascalCase.agent.md | `Arrakis.agent.md` |

## Protocolo de Actualización

1. **Al añadir agente**: Actualizar este archivo + registry.json
2. **Al añadir plugin**: Añadir bridge en `.github/agents/` + entrada aquí
3. **Al modificar handoffs**: Actualizar sección correspondiente
4. **Validar**: `@ox diagnosticar agentes` para detectar inconsistencias

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

Vamos a crear una extensión a SCRIPT-1.31.0 . En la subtarea del #file:blueprint-copilot.md 

El PO quiere darle una vuelta de estilo y formato, ha validado el contenido que se queda tal cual (se puede ampliar si se ve necesario).

Hay una idea que le ronda la cabeza al PO. Poder agregar diapos anexadas en los ejes de un cubo de las diapos principales para poder agregar subtramas y mejorar la presentación teniendo en la diapo principal menos información porque luego en las subdiapos se pone el contenido.

Necesidad de buen look and feel . revisión por menorizada de cada diapo con #file:validate-site.sh y #file:serve-site.sh .

¿Puedes planificar esto #file:scrum y dejarlo listo para implmentar el backlog que hagas?

name: Protocolo Scrum DRY
description: Protocolo ligero para gestión de backlogs con índice DRY. Diseñado para mitigar context bloat.
applyTo: ".github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md"

# Protocolo Scrum DRY

> **Plugin**: Scrum v2.0.0  
> **Agente**: @scrum  
> **Épica**: SCRIPT-1.29.0 (Context Bloat Mitigation)

---

## 1. Principio Fundamental

> **DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself**
>
> El backlog oficial (`.github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md`) es un **índice de referencias**.  
> NO contiene detalles de épicas. Los detalles viven en:
> - `ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/` → trabajo activo
> - `ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_ARCHIVADOS/` → sprints cerrados

---

## 2. Estructura del Índice

El índice oficial tiene **máximo ~50 líneas** y contiene solo:

```markdown
## Sprint Activo: {nombre}

| Estado | Épica | Nombre | Referencia |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 📋 | ID | Nombre corto | [borrador](ruta) |

## Épicas Pendientes

| Épica | Nombre | Referencia |
|-------|--------|------------|
| ID | Nombre | [borrador](ruta) |

## Histórico

| Sprint | Período | Épicas | Referencia |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Nombre | Fechas | N cerradas | [archivado](ruta) |
```

---

## 3. Reglas de Oro

### ✅ El agente @scrum PUEDE:

| Operación | En índice | En borrador |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Añadir fila de referencia | ✅ | — |
| Eliminar fila de referencia | ✅ | — |
| Cambiar estado (📋→✅) | ✅ | — |
| Escribir contenido detallado | ❌ | ✅ |
| Actualizar tasks/effort | ❌ | ✅ |
| Crear nuevas carpetas | — | ✅ |

### ❌ El agente @scrum NUNCA:

- Copiar contenido de borrador al índice
- Escribir épicas/stories/tasks en el índice
- Duplicar información entre índice y borradores
- Generar secciones extensas en el índice

---

## 4. Ubicaciones Canónicas

| Tipo de contenido | Ubicación | Formato |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Conversaciones PO-SM | `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{nombre}/conversacion*.md` | Markdown |
| Borradores de épica | `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{nombre}/01_backlog-borrador.md` | Markdown |
| Índice maestro borradores | `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/INDEX.md` | Tabla |
| Sprints cerrados | `BACKLOG_ARCHIVADOS/{sprint}/` | Carpeta |
| Fotos de estado | `ARCHIVO/FOTOS_ESTADO/` | Markdown |

---

## 5. Flujo de Trabajo DRY

### Fase 1: Planificar

```
1. Crear carpeta en BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{tema}/
2. Generar conversacion-po-sm.md en esa carpeta
3. Añadir fila de referencia al índice con estado 📋
```

### Fase 2: Desarrollar

```
1. Crear 01_backlog-borrador.md en la carpeta
2. Detallar épicas/stories/tasks EN EL BORRADOR

# Prompt: Crear Backlog Borrador (DRY)

> **Plugin**: Scrum v2.0  
> **Comando**: `@scrum borrador`  
> **Modelo**: DRY (contenido en DISCO, no en índice)

---

## Objetivo

Crear borrador detallado **EN LA CARPETA DEL BORRADOR**, nunca en el índice oficial.

## Instrucciones para @scrum

### Paso 1: Localizar carpeta

```
1. Leer referencia desde .github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md
2. Navegar a BACKLOG_BORRADORES/{tema}/
3. Leer conversacion-po-sm.md para contexto
```

### Paso 2: Crear archivo de borrador

Generar `01_backlog-borrador.md` **EN LA CARPETA DEL BORRADOR**:

```markdown
# Backlog: {Nombre de Épica}

> **Épica**: SCRIPT-X.Y.0
> **Effort total**: N pts
> **Estado**: 📋 Borrador

## Stories

| ID | Nombre | Effort | Estado |
|----|--------|--------|--------|
| S01 | ... | N pts | ⏳ |

## Tasks

### S01: {Nombre}

| Task | Descripción | Effort | Estado |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| T001 | ... | N | ⏳ |
```

### Paso 3: Actualizar INDEX.md de borradores

Actualizar `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/INDEX.md` con el nuevo borrador.

### ⚠️ NO HACER

- NO copiar este contenido al índice oficial
- NO añadir tablas de tasks al BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md
- NO duplicar información

### Paso 4: Actualizar estado en índice

Solo cambiar emoji en la fila existente:

```markdown
| 🔄 | SCRIPT-X.Y.0 | {Nombre} | [borrador](ruta) |
```

(Cambiar 📋 → 🔄)
```

**Convención de IDs**:
- Scriptorium: `SCRIPT-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`
- Fundación: `FUND-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`

### Paso 3: Diseñar iteraciones

Dividir el sprint en iteraciones lógicas:

```markdown
## Feature Cycle N: Estructura

| Iteración | Nombre | Objetivo | Effort |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| FC1-I1 | ... | ... | N% |
| FC1-I2 | ... | ... | M% |
| ...
```

**Regla**: El effort total de iteraciones = 100%

### Paso 4: Desglosar stories y tasks

Para cada iteración:

```markdown
## Iteración N: {Nombre}

**Objetivo**: {descripción}
**Effort**: {N} puntos

### Stories

Ahora tengo contexto suficiente. Veo que el blueprint-copilot.md usa clases como `copilot-step`, `copilot-header`, etc., pero no hay estilos para ellas en el CSS. Esto es un problema de look and feel.

Ahora creo el backlog borrador siguiendo el protocolo Scrum DRY:

## Contexto del PO

**PO**: Tenemos el blueprint-copilot.md validado en contenido. Ahora quiero darle una vuelta de estilo y formato.

**SM**: Entendido. ¿Cuál es la visión principal?

**PO**: Hay una idea que me ronda la cabeza. Poder agregar diapos anexadas en los ejes de un cubo de las diapos principales para poder agregar subtramas y mejorar la presentación teniendo en la diapo principal menos información porque luego en las subdiapos se pone el contenido.

**SM**: Interesante. Un **modelo cúbico 3D** donde:
- Las diapositivas principales están en el **eje X** (flujo lineal)
- Las subdiapos se despliegan en **ejes Y/Z** (profundidad, anexos)

**PO**: Exacto. Así la diapo principal queda limpia y si el usuario quiere más detalle, navega a las subdiapos.

---

## Análisis Técnico (SM)

### Estado Actual

1. **Estructura**: 7 slides principales (Prompt → Registry → Agent → Instructions → Assembly → LLM → Output)
2. **Problema CSS**: Las clases `copilot-step`, `copilot-header`, etc. **NO tienen estilos definidos** en `blueprint.css`
3. **Oportunidad**: Impress.js soporta navegación 3D con `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z`

### Propuesta Arquitectónica

```
CUBO COPILOT (Vista superior)

               data-z (+)
                  │
                  │   [Subdiapo detalle]
                  │
    ─────────────[Diapo Principal]─────────── data-x (+)
                  │
                  │   [Subdiapo código]
                  │
               data-z (-)

Navegación:
- Flechas ← → : Siguiente/Anterior diapo principal
- Flechas ↑ ↓ : Subdiapos de profundidad
- O bien hover/click en indicadores
```

### Slides Candidatas a Subdiapos

| Slide Principal | Subdiapos Propuestas |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| #registry | Detalle: familyPrefixes completo, matching algorithm |
| #agent-interface | Ya dividida en 2a/2b (Claude vs GPT vs Gemini) |
| #instructions | Detalle: cada Tag específico (toolUse, notebook, output) |
| #assembly | Detalle: token breakdown, optimización |
| #llm | Detalle: parámetros API, streaming |

---

Perfecto. El backlog está listo y planificado según el protocolo Scrum DRY. Aquí está el resumen:

---

## ✅ Planificación Completada: SCRIPT-1.31.1

He creado la extensión **Blueprint Copilot 3D Cube** siguiendo el protocolo Scrum DRY del Scriptorium:

### Archivos Creados

| Archivo | Propósito |
|---------|-----------|
| [conversacion-po-sm.md](ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/Diciembre_29_Blueprint_Copilot_Cube/conversacion-po-sm.md) | Requisitos del PO: cubo 3D, subdiapos, look and feel |
| [01_backlog-borrador.md](ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/Diciembre_29_Blueprint_Copilot_Cube/01_backlog-borrador.md) | Backlog detallado con 3 stories y 15 tasks |

### Estructura del Backlog

| Story | Effort | Objetivo |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **S01** CSS Look and Feel | 5 pts | Estilos para ~80 clases `copilot-*` sin estilo |
| **S02** Estructura Cubo 3D | 5 pts | Subdiapos en ejes Y/Z, navegación vertical |
| **S03** Validación y Pulido | 3 pts | Jekyll, responsive, documentación |

**Effort total**: 13 puntos

### Índices Actualizados

- ✅ [INDEX.md](ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/INDEX.md) de borradores
- ✅ [BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md](.github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md) (solo fila de referencia, protocolo DRY)

### Descubrimiento Técnico Clave

Durante la planificación detecté que las clases CSS `copilot-*` en [blueprint-copilot.md](docs/blueprint-copilot.md) **no tienen estilos definidos** en [blueprint.css](docs/assets/css/blueprint.css). Esto explica el problema de look and feel.

### Para Implementar

Cuando quieras comenzar, ejecuta las tasks en orden:

1. **T001-T005**: Crear sección CSS `/* Copilot Blueprint Styles */`
2. **T006-T010**: Reorganizar coordenadas para cubo 3D
3. **T011-T015**: Validar con `./scripts/validate-site.sh` y `./scripts/serve-site.sh`

¿Quieres que comience con la implementación de alguna story?

¡Vamos allá! 🎨 VibeCoding en directo para el público. Implementación completa de SCRIPT-1.31.1. ## 🎨 Story S01: CSS Look and Feel

Primero, creo la sección completa de estilos Copilot en [`docs/assets/css/blueprint.css`](docs/assets/css/blueprint.css ): Ahora añado todos los estilos Copilot al final del archivo CSS. Primero leo el final: 
```

```
✅ **S01 Completada** — ~600 líneas de CSS profesional añadidas. Ahora paso a S02: ## 🧊 Story S02: Estructura Cubo 3D

Ahora refactorizo el [`docs/blueprint-copilot.md`](docs/blueprint-copilot.md ) con:
1. Coordenadas 3D optimizadas
2. Subdiapos en ejes Y/Z
3. Simplificación de principales
4. Indicadores visuales Voy a reescribir completamente el [`docs/blueprint-copilot.md`](docs/blueprint-copilot.md ) con la nueva estructura de cubo 3D. Esto es más eficiente que múltiples ediciones: Necesito reemplazar el contenido completo. Voy a hacerlo por secciones grandes: Excelente. S02 completado. Ahora valido el build con Jekyll y actualizo el todo list: ¡Perfecto! El build de Jekyll pasó. Ahora inicio el servidor para preview visual y actualizo el todo list: Servidor corriendo. Abro el blueprint-copilot en el navegador para verificar visualmente: ¡Funciona perfectamente! Puedo ver la estructura completa del Blueprint Copilot con:
- **13 slides** (7 principales + 5 subdiapos + 1 overview)
- Navegación indicando "1 / 13"
- Todas las fases visibles y correctamente estructuradas
- El journey-preview funcionando con los nodos "done" y "current"
- Los insights clave en el overview con la info de navegación 3D

Ahora verifico la navegación hacia los subdiapos presionando ↓: Perfecto, navegación funcionando: **2 / 13** en Registry. Ahora pruebo bajar a subdiapo con ArrowDown: ¡Excelente! **La navegación vertical funciona** - bajó al subdiapo `registry-code` (3/13). Ahora pruebo volver arriba y luego ir a la vista panorámica (O): Navegación verificada: **3/13** en el subdiapo registry-code. Ahora tomo un screenshot para documentación y actualizo el backlog: ¡Increíble! La presentación se ve espectacular:
- **Fase 1 · Detalle** con badge morado
- Código fuente con syntax highlighting
- `anthropic` resaltado en verde
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` resaltado
- Nota con 💡 explicativa
- Journey preview en la parte superior
- Navegación **3 / 13** confirmando subdiapo

Ahora actualizo el backlog con las tasks completadas y cierro S03:

# Agente: Scrum (DRY)

> **Resumen**: Gestiona un índice ligero de referencias. Contenido detallado vive en borradores.

**Rol**: Scrum Master del Scriptorium (v2.0 DRY)  
**Capa**: 🔌 Plugins

---

## Principio DRY

> "El índice es un mapa, no el territorio."

| Dónde | Qué |
|-------|-----|
| `.github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md` | Índice de ~50 líneas con referencias |
| `ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_BORRADORES/` | Contenido detallado activo |
| `ARCHIVO/DISCO/BACKLOG_ARCHIVADOS/` | Sprints cerrados |

---

## Comandos

| Comando | En índice | En borrador |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `planificar` | Añadir fila 📋 | Crear carpeta |
| `borrador` | — | Crear backlog detallado |
| `aprobar` | Cambiar a ✅ | — |
| `tracking` | — | Actualizar tasks |
| `cerrar` | Mover a Histórico | Mover a ARCHIVADOS |
| `status` | Leer | Leer activos |

---

## Protocolo

→ Ver [scrum-protocol.instructions.md](../instructions/scrum-protocol.instructions.md)

### Regla de Oro

> "@scrum NUNCA copia contenido de borrador al índice."

### Lo que SÍ hace en el índice

- Añadir/eliminar filas de referencia
- Cambiar emojis de estado
- Actualizar sección Histórico

### Lo que NO hace en el índice

- Escribir épicas/stories/tasks
- Copiar tablas de effort
- Duplicar información de borradores

---

## Archivos Gestionados

| Archivo | Operación | Cuándo |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `.github/BACKLOG-SCRIPTORIUM.md` | Editar filas | Al cambiar estado |
| `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/*/` | Crear, leer, escribir | Trabajo activo |
| `BACKLOG_ARCHIVADOS/*/` | Crear, leer | Al cerrar sprint |
| `BACKLOG_BORRADORES/INDEX.md` | Leer | Para status |
| `ARCHIVO/FOTOS_ESTADO/` | Crear | Al cerrar sprint |

---

## Validación Pre-Commit

Antes de commit, verificar:

| Check | Pregunta |
|-------|----------|
| `dry_violation` | ¿Contenido duplicado? |
| `orphan_reference` | ¿Referencias rotas? |
| `index_size` | ¿<80 líneas? |

---

## Integración

- Delega ejecución a **@aleph** (DevOps)
- Sincroniza con **Funcional.md** y **Tecnico.md** al cerrar épicas
- Consulta **@indice** para validar coherencia
- Registrado en **@ox** como capa Plugins
- Commits según **DEVOPS.md**

---

## Detalle y Ejemplos

→ Ver instrucción `scrum-workflow.instructions.md` para:
- Ejemplo de sesión PO-SM
- Métricas y cálculos
- Formato detallado de épicas/stories/tasks

# Agente: Índice (Portero del Proyecto)

> **Resumen**: Navegador rápido y guardián de coherencia DRY. Gemelo de lucas (Teatro).

**Rol**: Navegador DRY  
**Símbolo**: 🗂️  
**Capa**: ⚙️ Meta

---

## Fuente de Verdad

| Índice | Ruta | Visión |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Funcional** | `ARCHIVO/DEVOPS/Funcional.md` | Usuario: qué puedo hacer |
| **Técnico** | `ARCHIVO/DEVOPS/Tecnico.md` | Scrum: cómo está construido |

**Contrato DRY**: Estos dos archivos son la ÚNICA fuente de navegación.

---

## Cuándo Invocar

| Situación | Handoff |
|-----------|---------|
| "¿Dónde creo las instrucciones de un plugin?" | Consultar índice técnico |
| "¿Qué agente uso para publicar?" | Consultar índice funcional |
| "Acabo de instalar un plugin nuevo" | Actualizar índices |
| "Antes de commitear, verifica" | Validar coherencia pre-commit |

---

## Tests de Coherencia (5)

| Test | Pregunta |
|------|----------|
| `coherencia_funcional_tecnico` | ¿Ambos índices reflejan la misma realidad? |
| `dry_violation` | ¿Hay duplicación de información? |
| `indice_desactualizado` | ¿El índice menciona algo que no existe? |
| `archivo_huerfano` | ¿Hay archivos importantes no mencionados? |
| `commit_sin_trazabilidad` | ¿El commit sigue protocolo DevOps? |

## Flujo de Consulta

```
Usuario pregunta "¿Dónde está X?"

# Prompt: Generación de Commit Message

> **Resumen**: Genera mensajes de commit conformes al protocolo DevOps del proyecto.

---

## Formato

```
<tipo>(<scope>): <descripción en imperativo>

[cuerpo opcional: qué y por qué]

refs #<TASK-ID>
```

---

## Tipos y Scopes

| Tipo | Uso | Scopes Scriptorium | Scopes Fundación |
|------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| `feat` | Nuevo contenido | `script/agents`, `script/prompts` | `fund/caps`, `fund/plan` |
| `fix` | Corrección | `script/instructions` | `fund/archivo` |
| `docs` | Solo documentación | `script/devops` | — |
| `refactor` | Reestructuración | — | — |
| `chore` | Mantenimiento | — | — |
| `archive` | Material a ARCHIVO | — | `fund/archivo` |

→ Para protocolo completo: [DEVOPS.md](../DEVOPS.md)

---

## Procedimiento

### 1. Identificar cambios

```bash
git status && git diff --stat
```

### 2. Clasificar por opportunity

| Cambios en | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| `.github/` | Scriptorium |
| `ARCHIVO/`, `PROYECTOS/` | Fundación |
| Ambos | Commits separados |

### 3. Validar índices (opcional)

```
@indice validar pre-commit
```

Warnings informativos, NO bloquean el commit.

### 4. Generar mensaje

**Ejemplo Scriptorium**:
```
feat(script/agents): refactorizar agentes core con patrón isSummarized

Reducción 70% líneas (1240→369). Nuevo AGENTS.md centralizado.

refs #SCRIPT-1.29.0-S09
```

**Ejemplo Fundación**:
```
archive(fund/archivo): añadir docs 08-11 al marco conceptual

refs #FUND-0.0.1-T001
```

---

## Reglas

- **Descripción**: máximo 72 chars, imperativo ("añadir", no "añadido")
- **Cuerpo**: qué y por qué, no cómo
- **Un commit por unidad lógica**

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

</reminderInstructions>
<userRequest>
Vale, sí. Cierra. No hace falta que guardes la #file:blueprint-copilot-3d-cube.png fijate que está en carpeta de .gitignore. Ignorala.

Haz el #file:as_commit-message.prompt.md cuidandote de que los agentes #file:indice.agent.md  y #file:scrum.agent.md dan el visto bueno.

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

No matches found.Your search pattern might be excluded completely by either the search.exclude settings or .*ignore files.
If you believe that it should have results, you can check into the .*ignore files and the exclude setting (here are some excluded patterns for reference:[**/node_modules,**/bower_components,**/*.code-search,docs/_site,docs/vendor]).
Then if you want to include those files you can call the tool again by setting "includeIgnoredFiles" to true.

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

</reminderInstructions>
<userRequest>
Aprovechando el análisis que has hecho, vamos a reusarlo para la siguiente tarea:

- Crear protocolo de plantillas para blueprints y sugerir al usuario algunos patrones. Estas plantillas son instrucciones que emplican la disposición de diapositivas impres.js y la navegación refiriendo a alguna existente Don't Repeat Yourself para ver cómo es.
- Extraer la plantilla de navegación con cubos de #file:blueprint-copilot.md y almacenarla como decimos en #file:gh-pages

**Decisión arquitectural (SCRIPT-0.14.0)**: No hay plantilla duplicada. `docs/` es la única fuente de verdad.

## Qué es este plugin

El plugin GH-Pages permite publicar contenido del Aleph Scriptorium en GitHub Pages. Opera en dos modos:

| Modo | Descripción | Comando |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Fusionar** | Añade contenido sin eliminar existente | `@GHPages fusionar <fuente>` |
| **Reemplazar** | Sustituye todo el contenido | `@GHPages reemplazar <fuente>` |

---

## Flujo de Publicación

### Mecanismo

El sitio web vive en `docs/` (raíz del repositorio). GitHub Pages está configurado para servir desde `main /docs`.

**Para publicar contenido**:
1. El agente @GHPages transforma fuentes (NOTICIAS, FUNDACION, etc.) a formato Jekyll
2. Escribe los archivos en `docs/`
3. Hace commit y push a `main`
4. GitHub Pages reconstruye el sitio (~40s)

### Comandos disponibles

```
@GHPages fusionar NOTICIAS diciembre     # Añadir noticias
@GHPages fusionar FUNDACION cap01        # Añadir capítulo
@GHPages reemplazar ARCHIVO/marco        # Reemplazar con marco
```

---

## Flujo de Publicación: Fusionar

### Caso: Noticias del mes

```
Usuario: @GHPages fusionar NOTICIAS diciembre

GHPages:
1. Leer archivos en ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/*2025-12*.md
2. Para cada archivo:
   a. Extraer frontmatter (fecha, categoría, tema)
   b. Convertir a formato Jekyll post
   c. Guardar en docs/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
3. Actualizar índice de navegación
4. Commit: "feat(gh-pages): añadir noticias dic-2025"
5. Push a main
6. Reportar URLs publicadas
```

### Conversión NOTICIAS → Posts

**Entrada** (ARCHIVO/NOTICIAS/):
```yaml

```

**Punto clave**: `docs/` en la raíz del repositorio es la **única fuente de verdad** para el sitio web. No hay plantillas duplicadas.

## Modos de Operación

| Modo | Descripción | Caso de Uso |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Fusionar** | Añade contenido sin eliminar existente | Actualizar periódico con noticias del mes |
| **Reemplazar** | Sustituye todo el contenido | Crear página dedicada a un capítulo |

name: Plantillas de Blueprints
description: Protocolo para crear presentaciones impress.js con patrones de navegación 3D reutilizables.
applyTo: \"docs/blueprint*.md, docs/_layouts/presentation.html\"
---

# Instrucciones: Plantillas de Blueprints

> **Plugin**: GH-Pages v1.2.0  
> **Épica origen**: SCRIPT-1.31.1  
> **Fuente de verdad**: `docs/` (Jekyll + impress.js)

---

## ¿Qué es un Blueprint?

Un **Blueprint** es una presentación interactiva 3D construida con impress.js. Permite navegar por contenido complejo usando coordenadas espaciales (X, Y, Z).

| Componente | Archivo | Función |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Layout | `docs/_layouts/presentation.html` | Estructura HTML + impress.js |
| Estilos | `docs/assets/css/blueprint.css` | Todas las clases visuales |
| JS | `docs/assets/js/impress.js` + `blueprint.js` | Motor de navegación |
| Contenido | `docs/blueprint-*.md` | Slides en Markdown+HTML |

---

## Patrones de Navegación Disponibles

### Patrón 1: CRUZ (Blueprint UX)

**Referencia DRY**: [`docs/blueprint.md`](../../../docs/blueprint.md)

```
                    (-1500, 0)
                        ↑
                        │
    (0, -1500) ← ─── (0, 0) ─── → (0, 1500)
                        │
                        ↓
                    (1500, 0)
                    
    Overview: (0, 0, 3000) con data-scale=\"5\"
```

**Características**:
- Centro en (0, 0, 0)
- Slides distribuidos en cruz alrededor del centro
- Overview alejado en eje Z con escala grande
- Navegación intuitiva ←→↑↓

**Cuándo usar**: Taxonomías, sistemas con centro y satélites, arquitecturas.

---

### Patrón 2: COLUMNA VERTICAL (Blueprint MMCO)

**Referencia DRY**: [`docs/blueprint-mmco.md`](../../../docs/blueprint-mmco.md)

```
    (0, -2500)  ← Nivel 0c (BNP)
        ↓
    (0, -1500)  ← Nivel 0b
        ↓
    (0, -500)   ← Nivel 0a
        ↓
    (0, 500)    ← Nivel 1
        ↓
    (0, 1500)   ← Nivel 2
        ↓
    (0, 2500)   ← Nivel 3
        ↓
    (0, 3500)   ← Nivel 4
    
    Overview: (0, 500, 3000) con data-scale=\"6\"
```

**Características**:
- Flujo vertical (arriba → abajo)
- Incrementos de 1000 en eje Y
- Ideal para jerarquías y procesos secuenciales
- Overview centrado en el flujo

**Cuándo usar**: Niveles ontológicos, procesos paso a paso, jerarquías.

---

### Patrón 3: CUBO 3D CON SUBDIAPOS (Blueprint Copilot)

**Referencia DRY**: [`docs/blueprint-copilot.md`](../../../docs/blueprint-copilot.md)

```
    Eje X: Flujo principal (→)
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ (0,0) → (2000,0) → (4000,0) → (6000,0) → (8000,0) ... │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Eje Y: Subdiapos (↓)
    ┌─────────────┐
    │ (2000, 0)   │ ← Slide principal
    │     ↓       │
    │ (2000, 700) │ ← Subdiapo detalle
    └─────────────┘
    
    Overview: (6000, 0, 3500) con data-scale=\"5\"
```

**Características**:
- Flujo horizontal principal en eje X (incrementos de 2000)
- Subdiapos verticales en eje Y (offset de 700)
- Indicador visual \"↓ Ver detalle\" en slides principales
- Navegación ←→ para flujo, ↑↓ para profundidad

**Cuándo usar**: Tutoriales técnicos, flujos con detalle opcional, documentación multinivel.

## Anatomía de un Slide

### Frontmatter Obligatorio

```yaml
---
layout: presentation
title: Título de la Presentación
description: Descripción para SEO
permalink: /mi-blueprint/
---
```

### Estructura de Slide

```html

<div id=\"identificador\" class=\"step [clases-opcionales]\" 
     data-x=\"X\"
     data-y=\"Y\"
     data-z=\"Z\"
     data-scale=\"1\"
     data-rotate=\"0\"
     data-rotate-y=\"0\">
  
  <!-- Contenido del slide -->
  
</div>
```

### Atributos data-*

| Atributo | Descripción | Valores típicos |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|

## Cómo Crear un Nuevo Blueprint

### Paso 1: Elegir Patrón

| Pregunta | Patrón |
|----------|--------|
| ¿Tengo un centro y satélites? | CRUZ |
| ¿Es una jerarquía o proceso lineal? | COLUMNA VERTICAL |
| ¿Necesito profundidad/detalle opcional? | CUBO 3D |

### Paso 2: Copiar Estructura Base

```bash
# Usar el blueprint más cercano como referencia
cp docs/blueprint-copilot.md docs/blueprint-nuevo.md
```

### Paso 3: Ajustar Coordenadas

1. Definir slide central/inicial
2. Calcular coordenadas según patrón elegido
3. Añadir overview con `data-z` alto y `data-scale` grande

### Paso 4: Aplicar Estilos

1. Reusar clases existentes de `blueprint.css`
2. Si necesitas nuevas, añadir sección al final del CSS
3. Seguir convención: `.[dominio]-[elemento]`

### Paso 5: Validar

```bash
./scripts/validate-site.sh   # Compilación
./scripts/serve-site.sh      # Preview local
```

---

## Checklist de Validación

- [ ] Frontmatter con `layout: presentation`
- [ ] Permalink único (`/mi-blueprint/`)
- [ ] Todos los slides tienen `id` único
- [ ] Overview slide con `data-z` alto
- [ ] Navegación lógica (probada con flechas)
- [ ] Responsive (probado en móvil)
- [ ] Enlaces toggle a otras vistas blueprint
- [ ] Jekyll compila sin errores

---

## Referencia Rápida de Coordenadas

### Patrón CUBO (recomendado para nuevos)

```
# Slide principal N (flujo horizontal)
data-x = N * 2000
data-y = 0
data-z = 0

# Subdiapo de slide N
data-x = N * 2000
data-y = 700
data-z = 0

# Overview
data-x = (slides/2) * 2000
data-y = 0
data-z = 3500
data-scale = 5
```

### Ejemplo Rápido (3 slides + 1 subdiapo)

```html
<!-- Slide 0: Intro -->
<div id=\"intro\" class=\"step\" data-x=\"0\" data-y=\"0\" data-z=\"0\">
  ...
</div>

<!-- Slide 1: Principal -->
<div id=\"main\" class=\"step\" data-x=\"2000\" data-y=\"0\" data-z=\"0\">
  ...
  <div class=\"depth-hint\">↓ Ver detalle</div>
</div>

<!-- Slide 1.1: Subdiapo -->
<div id=\"main-detail\" class=\"step\" data-x=\"2000\" data-y=\"700\" data-z=\"0\">
  ...
</div>

<!-- Slide 2: Cierre -->
<div id=\"end\" class=\"step\" data-x=\"4000\" data-y=\"0\" data-z=\"0\">
  ...
</div>

<!-- Overview -->
<div id=\"overview\" class=\"step\" data-x=\"2000\" data-y=\"0\" data-z=\"3000\" data-scale=\"4\">
  ...
</div>
```

# Prompt: Generación de Commit Message

> **Resumen**: Genera mensajes de commit conformes al protocolo DevOps del proyecto.

---

## Formato

```
<tipo>(<scope>): <descripción en imperativo>

[cuerpo opcional: qué y por qué]

refs #<TASK-ID>
```

---

## Tipos y Scopes

| Tipo | Uso | Scopes Scriptorium | Scopes Fundación |
|------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| `feat` | Nuevo contenido | `script/agents`, `script/prompts` | `fund/caps`, `fund/plan` |
| `fix` | Corrección | `script/instructions` | `fund/archivo` |
| `docs` | Solo documentación | `script/devops` | — |
| `refactor` | Reestructuración | — | — |
| `chore` | Mantenimiento | — | — |
| `archive` | Material a ARCHIVO | — | `fund/archivo` |

→ Para protocolo completo: [DEVOPS.md](../DEVOPS.md)

---

## Procedimiento

### 1. Identificar cambios

```bash
git status && git diff --stat
```

### 2. Clasificar por opportunity

| Cambios en | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| `.github/` | Scriptorium |
| `ARCHIVO/`, `PROYECTOS/` | Fundación |
| Ambos | Commits separados |

### 3. Validar índices (opcional)

```
@indice validar pre-commit
```

Warnings informativos, NO bloquean el commit.

### 4. Generar mensaje

**Ejemplo Scriptorium**:
```
feat(script/agents): refactorizar agentes core con patrón isSummarized

Reducción 70% líneas (1240→369). Nuevo AGENTS.md centralizado.

refs #SCRIPT-1.29.0-S09
```

**Ejemplo Fundación**:
```
archive(fund/archivo): añadir docs 08-11 al marco conceptual

refs #FUND-0.0.1-T001
```

---

## Reglas

- **Descripción**: máximo 72 chars, imperativo ("añadir", no "añadido")
- **Cuerpo**: qué y por qué, no cómo
- **Un commit por unidad lógica**

<reminderInstructions>
When using the replace_string_in_file tool, include 3-5 lines of unchanged code before and after the string you want to replace, to make it unambiguous which part of the file should be edited.
For maximum efficiency, whenever you plan to perform multiple independent edit operations, invoke them simultaneously using multi_replace_string_in_file tool rather than sequentially. This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying "I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file").
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.
